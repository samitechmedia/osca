            <p>
                 As the name implies, a <a href="/guides/welcome-bonus" rel="nofollow noreferrer">welcome bonus</a> is the way a casino welcomes new players.
                 This is typically the first bonus that a player will claim at an online casino. Other names for a welcome bonus 
                 or welcome package include sign up bonuses or new player promotions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Welcome bonuses for slots players are a simple idea. Online casinos want more players, so they give you a bonus
                when you sign up from your desktop or mobile. Most of these offers are 100% of your first deposit up to a certain 
                amount. For example, let's look at a hypothetical player: John. He wants to cash-in on a 100% bonus worth up to $600.
            </p>
            <p>
                If he deposits $300, he'll receive an extra $300 in bonus money to play with; if he deposits $480, he'll receive
                $480 in bonus money; and so on and so forth up to $600. Let's say, though, that John decides to deposit $1,000.
                In this example his bonus will only be worth $600 - the maximum amount for this bonus offer.
            </p>

            <h2 class="title title--h2">How Do I Clam A Casino Welcome Bonus?</h2>
            <p>
                Casinos make it very easy to claim your welcome bonus. While some sites still use codes to activate the bonus, most
                of them do it automatically. A common method is for a casino to send an activation email which you’ll need to click
                on in order to transfer the bonus to your casino account, while others will simply ask you to accept the terms and
                conditions in a pop-up before depositing the bonus into your account. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Whichever option a casino chooses, it will be made transparent – just be sure to read the instructions and the T&Cs. If you get stuck, contact the casino directly or head to their FAQs page.

                    Seeing all that bonus cash in your casino account can be inspiring and exciting. You can use it for all your online gambling, but at a certain point you might want to withdraw your bonus and use those funds for other things. Keep in mind that sticky bonuses can't be withdrawn, but other bonuses can.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In order to withdraw your bonus winnings, you'll need to meet the casino's requirements. This usually includes meeting wagering requirements, playing with the funds a certain number of times, or playing specific games. This is why it's best to check the terms and conditions of bonuses before you claim them, so that you know exactly how long it can take.

            <h2 class="title title--h2">What are wagering requirements?</h2>
            <p>
                If casinos just gave away hundreds of dollars in bonuses, they'd go instantly bankrupt. Instead, bonuses are usually subject to wagering requirements, where you need to wager the bonus cash a certain number of times before it can be withdrawn. Some wagering requirements are applied to just the bonus amount, while others apply to the bonus and deposit amount. Free spins can also have wagering requirements for the winnings.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, a casino might have a 40x wagering requirement. This means that if you get a $100 welcome bonus, you'll need to use bonus funds to wager $4,000 before you can withdraw your bonus winnings. This is why it's important to only deposit the amount you want to gamble with, rather than chasing bonuses. They are there to give you extra play sessions rather than lucrative payouts.

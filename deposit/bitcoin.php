                    <p>While other payment methods like Credit Cards and
                        eWallets may be more well known, playing at online
                        casino with bitcoin is slowly gaining traction as
                        players realise that bitcoin can offer them a number of
                        benefits not offered by other banking methods. So, what
                        is bitcoin?</p>

                    <p>Bitcoin is a form of digital currency that is not
                        regulated by any government but rather by other bitcoin
                        users. Bitcoin transactions work by transferring value
                        between wallets, with each wallet identifiable through a
                        unique digital code. These wallets can be bought and
                        sold on various marketplaces at the currency of your
                        choice meaning that bitcoin is truly a universal form of
                        currency.</p>

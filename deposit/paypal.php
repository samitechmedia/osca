            <h2 class="title title--h2">Why PayPal is Restricted at Online Casinos in Canada</h2>
            <p>
                In 2010 PayPal updated their user agreement to accept online gambling in regulated markets. As Canada
                allows offshore gambling, PayPal is blocked. <strong>That means there are no casinos that accept PayPal
                    in Canada</strong>. Not even licensed and legitimate casinos can accept deposits or withdrawals with
                PayPal.
            </p>
            <p>
                Don’t try to use a VPN or go around the PayPal restrictions any other way as no legitimate real money
                casino will allow this. Instead, use one of the deposit methods listed below.
            </p>
            <h3 class="title title--h3-no-bg-color">Alternatives to PayPal at Online Casinos</h3>
            <p>
                You can easily use another e-wallet or stick with a safe and trusted option such as a debit- or credit
                card. If you prefer a banking method that allows for more anonymity, Bitcoin is your best choice.
                They’re all 100% safe, quick, and legal to use at Canadian online casinos.

            <h2 class="title title--h2">What is PayPal?</h2>
            <p>At its core, your PayPal account is an e-wallet that you can easily use for buying online. If you don't
                have an account, you can sign up in a few minutes for free. Simply link your credit card or bank info to
                your PayPal account. With total purchase protection and the best security in the business, your funds
                are always safe. That's true whether or not you play online <a href="/" class="text--link">slots</a>.
            </p>
            <h3 class="title title--h3-no-bg-color">How Does PayPal Work at Online Casinos?</h3>
            <p>If you’re playing from another country, such as Malta, Sweden, the UK or any other regulated market you
                can use PayPal for your online casino deposits. </p>
            <p>PayPal will authorize the <a href="/real-money" class="text--link">real money</a> transaction and
                transfer the funds on your behalf. The site will receive your real cash without having access to your
                credit card or bank account. It's the ultimate in security and privacy. PayPal isn't only convenient; it
                might very well be the smartest way to pay and play. With the option of linking your bank account,
                PayPal is a great choice for players who don't have a credit card or want to control their spending.</p>
            <h2 class="title title--h2">History of PayPal in Online Casinos </h2>
            <p>PayPal was established in 1998 under the name “Confinity” in the US and changed its name to PayPal in the
                early 2000s. After being bought by eBay in 2002 it quickly became one of the most popular e-wallets
                worldwide. In 2021 PayPal boasts a whopping 325 million active users, across 200 markets!
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2003 PayPal stopped allowing deposits to be made at all online casinos worldwide. Later, in 2010,
                PayPal changed its user agreement again. Now it’s allowing regulated online gambling markets to use its
                services. Unfortunately, that doesn’t include Canada as the Canadian government allows offshore
                gambling.
            </p>
            <h2 class="title title--h2">PayPal Safety and Security </h2>
            <p><a href="/guides/security" class="text--link">Security</a> and privacy are huge concerns in 2021. PayPal
                gives you an extra layer of protection when using it for online shopping. PayPal uses advanced 128-bit
                encryption to process payments and takes advantage of the latest technologies to monitor your account
                and eliminate fraud. The best part is you can take advantage of this added protection, while still using
                the credit cards and bank accounts you love.
            </p>
            <p>
                Many players prefer to use PayPal when testing out new casinos as you don’t have to share your banking
                details. This is also true for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or pre-paid cards such as <a
                  href="/deposit/neosurf" class="text--link">NeoSurf</a>. Both these options are available for playing
                in Canada and offer the same levels of safety and security as PayPal.

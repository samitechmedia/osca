            It's easy and exactly the same process as any online shopping. With your credit or debit card details securely entered onto the online casino's banking system, the funds are lifted directly there from. It's actually so uncomplicated for the host site and the visiting user that many online casinos prefer this method and helps explain how debit and credit cards are the leading method of payment for online casinos in Canada.

        <div class="accordion__content">
          <p>
            As gambling is legal in most parts of Canada, almost every credit or debit card provider will allow for online casino deposits and, what's more, understand the need for discretion. The universally popular pair Visa and Mastercard are by far the highest used cards.

            That's entirely up to you. The main difference is money you have versus money you borrow, so we can't advise either way. What we can say is both are perfectly safe, reasonable and normal methods of fund depositing. Also, remember that putting money straight back onto a debit card will find its way back into your bank account where as anything entered on to your credit card will not.

            Extremely! Despite this there are those that remain unconvinced and prefer to keep their bank details offline. If this applies to you then it may be best to consider an e-wallet option, of which there are many, all of which we have reviewed here. For those that are happy to use their cards online, they can be certain that security measures are in place to help prevent issued such as fraud and that any sensitive information is safe.

            Fortunately there are no fees applied to a deposit which is a good thing as it stops players making larger deposits in order of avoiding fees as some other international services have been known to do. Of course, if you use a credit card then interest is applied at the rate agreed when you signed for the card.

            You could say that - they have become Canadians leading choice of online casino payments. The casinos themselves actually prefer this method too. So with both user and site opting for card payments, they are the preferred choice.

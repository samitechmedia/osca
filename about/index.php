        <p><img class="artright" alt="About us" src="/images/art/about3.jpg" width="173" height="130"> Welcome to OnlineSlots.ca! This site was
            built specifically to help Canadian slots players find the action they need and, with extensive combined
            experience in the field, we have no doubt that we can help you get started. In case you haven't already had
            a chance to take a look around our site, let us give you a quick introduction and show you exactly what it
            is that we have to offer.</p>
        <h2 class="title title--h2">An Expert Online Slots Casino Guide</h2>
        <p>You already know how to play - the question is which sites you can really count on. Canadian slots players
            like you form a multi-billion dollar industry, according to the most recent
            <a href="https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/75-001-x/2011004/article/11551-eng.htm">Canadian statistics</a>, so
            there are many sites out there that want a shot at your business. The casinos listed on our site were
            carefully chosen after being reviewed by our expert Canadian staff, all of which are keen slots players just
            like you. These sites take all of the most popular Canadian friendly deposit options, offer both English and
            French support, and are known for secure and fair gambling - no matter where you're from. These are the
            online casinos that you can trust - both to keep you safe and to offer unmatched gambling experiences.</p>
        <h2 class="title title--h2">How We Find The Best Slots Sites</h2>
        <p>After evaluating so many online casinos, we now have a process; a way to go through all of the biggest
            options on the web and narrow them down to a few, top contenders. To accomplish this, we look at:</p>
        <ul class="bullet__list bullet__list--check-green type-margin-bottom">
            <li class="bullet__item">Welcome bonuses</li>
            <li class="bullet__item">Slots game selections</li>
            <li class="bullet__item">Customer promotions</li>
            <li class="bullet__item">Deposit options</li>
            <li class="bullet__item">Reliability of software</li>
            <li class="bullet__item">Auditing and certification</li>
        </ul>
        <p>So, why do we do it? It's simple, really. We want Canadians to know where they stand when it comes to playing
            slots online and where they can go to play worry-free. We know how difficult it can be to start from
            scratch, so we want to take this opportunity to share our experience and knowledge with the players who can
            take full advantage of it. If, after browsing our site, you find an Canadian slots site that ends up working
            well for you, then we've done exactly what we set out to do. For more information about casinos in Canada,
            we recommend visiting the <a href="https://www.tripsavvy.com/gambling-in-canada-1482066" target="_blank">TripSavvy.com

            <p>Before we wrap things up, we want to encourage you to play smart and be responsible. That means setting
                your limits and sticking to them. It means not gambling with money that you can't afford to lose.
                Remember, online gambling is a hobby - it's not a career. If you find that things are getting out of
                control and your gambling habits are interfering with other important parts of your life, you should get
                help immediately. You can find help at the following websites:</p>

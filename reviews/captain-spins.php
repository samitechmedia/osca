                        <p>
                            There is a good range of payment methods available for Captain Spins customers. Deposit minimums
                                are set at €10 (€20 for UK players) and can be made via Bank transfer, Interac Maestro, Mastercard, 
                                MuchBetter NETELLER, Paysafecard, Skrill, SoFort, Trustly, and Visa. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In terms of withdrawals, all the same banking options are available apart from Paysafecard, 
                            which is a deposit-only method. Captain Spins takes 48 hours to process withdrawals, 
                            which is a little slower than we’d hope for, with some casinos offering 
                            <a href="/fast-payouts" class="text--link">24-hour withdrawal times</a> or less for the same service.  
                            Once released by the casino, withdrawals take different times depending on the chosen method. eWallets 
                            like Skrill can be instant, while credit and debit card withdrawals take 2-5 business days. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There is a weekly withdrawal limit of €5,000, which should be enough for most players. 
                            These limits can be extended for those who are part of the Captain Spins VIP program.

                        <p>
                            Captain Spins is licensed by two of the most trusted iGaming regulators. 
                            The Malta Gaming Authority (MGA) and the United Kingdom Gambling Commission (UKGC) 
                            have both licensed the casino. Regular audits are also carried out by 
                            <a href="/guides/ecogra" class="text--link">eCogra</a> as well as the regulatory bodies to 
                            ensure fair play across all games, and to ensure player safety and security is at optimum levels.

                        <p>
                            Captain Spins is a welcome addition to the competitive iGaming market, offering everything 
                            we expect from a top-quality casino, and doing it all with its own unique personality. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The site looks great with its sleek, high-quality design, which houses thousands of excellent 
                            games, especially good for slots players but with enough variety to appeal to most casino fans. 
                            The welcome bonus is impressive, although the wagering requirements are steep, and the consistent 
                            promotions for existing customers, including the VIP program, keep things interesting too.

                    <p>There are not a lot of Canadian casinos that can match the pedigree of Party Casino. The operator is huge and highly respected in the online gambling business so all of its products are designed to live up to higher standards than the regular casino. After it launched in 1997, the platform quickly became a hit and continues to improve to this day. The online casino now has games from quite a few different software providers but the ones available can differ from country to country. In Canada, the main developer is <a href="/software/microgaming" class="text--link">Microgaming</a>  and its big slots are featured on the website. There are also unique progressive slots from Party Gaming that are very exclusive and fun to play due to their features and themes.

                    </ul>
                    <p>It won't take long to see that Party Casino Canada is in a different league and it is easy to fall in love with it. The first thing that becomes obvious is the selection of slots that may not be that big but is only made out of hit titles. There
                    is variety that goes beyond spinning the reels and this includes an awesome live dealer casino. Secondly, the site will work really well on smartphones running Apple, Android or Windows and no matter what device is used to bet, security is top-notch.
                    The third and final thing that made a good impression is the loyalty program that caters to casual players, serious gamblers and high rollers. Basically, if you are a fan of online casino games, Party Casino promises a great time.</p>

                        <h2 class="title title--h2">Great Bonus &amp; Features</h2>
                        <p>Players from Canada are welcomed to join the gaming party and if they register and make a first deposit, the casino will match that payment 100% to add up to C$100 in the account for free. The best part about this bonus is that once it is claimed
                            the money is there for all of the games, although slots have better rates for clearing the wagering requirements than blackjack. When filling out the deposit info, WELCOMEBONUS should be entered as the code.</p>
                        <p>The features that make Party Casino Canada so awesome start with the combined efforts of multiple developers. Microgaming and Party Gaming may be the two big ones in Canada but the list also shows games from NextGen Gaming, Lightning Box Games,
                            Ash Gaming and more. Some of the functions are small but very convenient, such as the option to search for a game or simply add one to favourites with one click. Other features are more noticeable, like the progressive jackpot shared by several
                            proprietary slots that can exceed C$3,000,000.</p>
                        <p>Then there are the standard modern features found in slots, like bonus games, free spins, stacked wilds and so on. These are so common with leading software providers that most players just expect them with every slot machine nowadays. Even
                            with all of these ways to generate wins for players, the games follow certain payout rates and the outcome of every spin is determined with the help of a random number generator, which has been certified as being fair by eCOGRA.</p>
                        <p>Everything can be done from the Party Casino site or by downloading the software for personal computers. The second option will include extra games that can bring some of the vintage slot titles to your gaming experience.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="review__casino-block">
                        <h2 class="title title--h2">Mobile</h2>
                        <p>The number of players in Canada that enjoy
                            <a href="/mobile" class="text--link">mobile betting</a>  is huge and this further pushes Party Casino to the top of the list thanks to its fantastic mobile platform. There are many things that can make a mobile casino good, such as great compatibility, a lot of games, simple interface
                            and secure banking options. Party Mobile Casino has all of this and more for your gaming session on the move.
                        </p>
                        <p>When it comes to the mobile devices that can run the mobile casino, most of the smartphones and tablets available on the market right now will easily live up to the task. This is because of the software used to power the website and its ability
                            to change to match the screen and operating system automatically. There is even an iPhone and iPad application on iTunes for installing the casino on mobile devices with iOS 6.0 or later.</p>
                        <p>In the games department we found some of the big titles from Microgaming, Cryptologic, Party Gaming and other developers available in Canada. We also liked that the new video slots launched on the full platform were already available on the
                            mobile website and each option can be started with a simple tap after logging in. And if you have already played from a computer, you can log in and continue from where you left off for real money securely on your preferred device. Beyond
                            the mobile slots and progressives that we love so much, Party Casino Mobile also has table games for Blackjack and Roulette, as well as live dealers.</p>
                        <p>After a quick loading time, the site will load and it keeps a very simplistic blue theme where the interface can be opened to get access to the account, the available free spins, the games, the current promotions and the options for reaching
                            the support team. Basically everything you need is on the mobile platform and you can complete instant deposits, claim the bonuses, use the money to place bets on your favourite mobile slots and casino games and then withdraw the winnings.
                            Even with the list of games being smaller than the one for desktop, players will likely enjoy their time with the mobile casino and can do so at any time throughout the day.</p>

                        <h2 class="title title--h2">Deposit Options</h2>
                        <p>Talking about online banking is not the flashiest topic but it is crucial for a perfect gaming experience. Party Casino Canada takes its online security very seriously and it aims to make it as simple as possible for players not only when making
                            deposits but also when withdrawing their money.</p>
                        <p>In total, there aren't a lot of
                            <a href="/deposit/" class="text--link">deposit options</a>  available in the cashier right now but they don't really need to be that many. As long as the most frequently used ones are covered, most players should be happy and this is exactly the case here. First of all, cards from
                            MasterCard and Visa are hugely popular across Canada and they are often times used to complete payments on the internet. Party Casino accepts them and also features the big web wallets in the cashier, such as NETELLER, Skrill and PayPal. Citadel,
                            Paysafecard, EntroPay, Trustly and bank transfers are available as well so there are more than enough methods to choose from.</p>
                        <p>Deposits can be made in Canadian Dollars and this currency can actually be selected right from the start, when creating the account. Withdrawing money takes about 72 hours on average but e-wallets are usually much faster since they only require
                            the 24 hour pending period to be over.</p>
                    </div>

                        <h2 class="title title--h2">Game Variety</h2>
                        <p>It is no surprise that Party Casino mostly offers slots. However, the game variety is actually pretty good with the
                        addition of a full live casino, realistic online table games, video poker and a few extra games. Any of these categories can be selected with ease on the website and progressive jackpot slots get their own category because they certainly deserve it with their impressive prizes just waiting to be won.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="review__casino-block">
                        <h2 class="title title--h2">Conclusion</h2>
                        <p>We had a feeling of what Party Casino is capable of as we went into the online casino review but it still managed to impress us in different ways. First of all, what really makes the casino great and what is arguably the most important part
                            for most players is the gaming offer. It may not be huge but it is packed with great online slots, including massive progressives from Party Gaming. And it also has plenty of table games, be them standard or with live dealers.</p>
                        <p>The cute welcome bonus will help new players get settled in and the other reload bonuses and special promotions will provide even more ways to add money into the account without any problems. And speaking of adding money, deposits are very safe
                            and instant at Party Casino, without any fees being taken by the operator. The same can be said about withdrawals so users can get their funds in and out of the casino hassle-free. It is a highly recommended brand in Canada and the overall
                            rating certainly shows just how good we found it to be.</p>

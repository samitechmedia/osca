                        <p>The quality of customer service at Royal Panda is fantastic. Helpful and cooperative customer support personnel can be reached live via chat and hotline between 9 am and 12:30 am (GMT+1), seven days a week. They can also be emailed for more
                            complicated questions or concerns. There is even a helpful FAQ section with the most commonly asked casino questions and their respective answers. We suggest browsing through this section before you contact the company because chances are,
                            you’ll find your answers here.</p>
                        <p>Besides the special promotions, rewarding bonuses, impressive gaming inventory, and large jackpots, Royal Panda has a unique aspect called ‘hot and cold slots’. Under this, you can find out which slots are currently ‘hot’ or spilling out jackpots,
                            and which have not paid out for a while. Read our Royal Panda review to find out more amazing aspects of the casino.</p>
                        <h2 class="title title--h2">Great Bonuses &amp; Features</h2>
                        <p>Just like many online casinos attract players with welcome bonuses, Royal Panda does the same with a good match deposit bonus of 100% of up to C$100. So if your initial deposit is a C$100, then you will have a total of C$200 to play your favourite
                            casino games. What’s more is that Royal Panda casino doesn’t have unreasonable wagering requirements. You are only required to make cash wagers up to 35x, after which the bonus is all yours to keep. Another aspect is that any winnings made
                            on your initial deposit can be withdrawn even if you haven’t completed the playthrough requirement. Slots, scratch cards and soft games contribute 100% while the rest of the games only contribute 10% to the wagers required.</p>
                        <p>Apart from the welcome bonus, there are also other exciting promotions at Royal Panda. One such promotion is the Lucky 21 promotion in which on the 21
                            <sup>st</sup> of every month, if you land blackjack, you can bag C$210 if you get selected from the lucky draw. There is also a Bamboo Bonus that is active every Friday in which you can boost your balance by 50% up to C$150.</p>
                        <p>Royal Panda rewards players for their loyalty through the Loyal Panda program. Once you sign up at the casino, you automatically start gathering loyalty points whether you win or lose at the casino games you play. These loyalty points can be
                            later redeemed for free spins, bonuses, and prizes such as electronics, jewelry, vacations and even imaginative gifts such as trips to space.</p>

                        <p>As mentioned earlier, Royal Panda does not have a downloadable casino version. You can expect the same for the mobile casino where you do not have to bother downloading casino apps on your handheld devices. At the moment of writing this Royal
                            Panda mobile review, there are no mobile casino apps for iOS, Apple, Windows or Blackberry devices. Nevertheless, Royal Panda is compatible with all major smartphones and tablets.</p>

                        <p>At Royal Panda online casino, Canadian players can have access to a range of banking options available for depositing funds and withdrawing winnings from their online casino account. Every online player prefers financial options that credit
                            funds quickly and withdraw winnings in the shortest duration possible in a secure manner. Royal Panda’s extensive list of deposit methods include debit and credit cards from MasterCard and Visa, direct bank transfers, e-wallets such as Skrill
                            and Neteller, and prepaid cards such as PaySafeCard and AstroPay Card. Most of these methods credit your online Royal Panda account almost instantaneously, without hassle, so that you can enjoy games without much waiting. Usually the minimum

                            utilize those funds for gambling. Otherwise, cashing out with eWallets takes a day, while Fast Bank Transfer or VISA and MasterCard takes between 1 and 5 days for the transaction to complete. The minimum amount you can withdraw is C$10, while
                            the maximum is C$50,000 for credit or debit card and it is C$100,000 for the rest of the banking methods. Players requesting cashouts are required to give legitimate proof of identification before funds can be processed. During our Royal Panda
                            online casino review, we also found that there is an “in-game deposit” feature through which Canadian gamblers can carry out deposit transactions without closing the game.</p>
                        <p>All the banking methods are completely secure and you can carry out your financial transactions without any stress.</p>

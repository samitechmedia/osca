                    <p>We assume you are reading this review because you live in Canada and need help finding a top quality casino for playing your favourite online slots. Trying to decide on your own which of the hundreds of <a href="/reviews/" class="text--link">online casinos</a> accepting
          Canadian players is worth your while can be a daunting task. But that’s what we’re here for. We carefully scrutinize many of these casinos and then handpick only the very best to recommend to our readers. Gaming Club is one of those casinos,
          and here are 10 great reasons why.</p>
                    <ul class="bullet__list bullet--text">

                    </ul>
                    <p>Let’s start with longevity. How could you not be impressed by a casino that was not only a pioneer in the online gambling movement, but is still going strong more than 20 years later? One of the reasons why Gaming Club remains the top choice of savvy slot players from Canada and around the world is that its continually updated software is as 21st century ready as that of the newest online casinos. The same applies to the internationally renowned software company, Microgaming that powers The Gaming Club. Both The Gaming Club and Microgaming were founded in 1994. Keeping up with the times and giving today’s sophisticated players the superior online gambling experience they demand is what keeps these companies in business.</p>
                    <p>Another big plus is that Gaming Club Canada is <a href="https://ecogra.org/" class="text--link" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"">eCogra</a> certified. The eCogra seal of approval assures you that you are dealing with a casino whose practices have been found to be consistently safe and fair. You can check this organization’s monthly updated report on the casino website yourself. Our latest report in 2015 found the average payouts for both for slots and for all games combined to be over 96%.Considering the fact that the aptly named Gaming Club is home to more than 500 games,
                    of which more than 400 are slots, and there is not a bad one among them, that is impressive! Unfortunately, Gaming Club is off limits to U.S. players, but for Canadians, becoming a Gaming Club player is easy. All you have to do is sign up, and
                    within minutes, access to your favourite slots and table games 24/7, wherever you happen to be, is yours. Simply choose from these three convenient ways of playing.</p>

                        <h2 class="title title--h2">Great Bonus &amp; Features</h2>
                        <p>Unless you are brand new to online slots, you know that finding your luckiest machines, even among slots with very high rates of return, like those at Gaming Club, might take time. So having enough ammunition to stay in the game and weather
                            any temporary runs of not so great luck is imperative. The Gaming Club Welcome Bonus is ideally suited to help you do just that. Here is how the Gaming Club Welcome Bonus works.</p>
                        <h3 class="title title--h4">First deposit 100% match up to C$200 on a C$200 deposit</h3>
                        <h3 class="title title--h4">Second deposit 150% match up to C$150 on a C$100 deposit</h3>
                        <p>Both deposits must be made during your first week of play. The playthroiugh requirement in each instance is a rather hefty 50x, but there is a silver lining:</p>
                        <ol class="reviewtick">
                            <li>The playthrough does not include your deposit like it does at some online casinos.</li>
                            <li>Slots, including <a href="/progressive-jackpots">progressive slots</a> (along with keno and scratch cards) count 100%. If you are a high roller, you might have your heart set on a bigger bonus.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>However, remember that bigger doesn’t always mean better with bonuses because they usually come with much bigger wagering requirements and harder to meet terms. Besides if you are a big player, there will be plenty of opportunities for you to
                            be rewarded appropriately later on in the casino’s <a href="/vip">VIP program</a>. If you are a small player and the required play for the maximum bonus looks too steep for you, simply deposit less and take a smaller bonus. In any case, as soon as you meet the
                            indicated wagering requirements (which should not take long if you play often), your winnings, your deposit, and the bonus itself are yours to keep.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="review__casino-block">
                        <h2 class="title title--h2">Loyalty Rewards and Other Promotions</h2>
                        <p>Most Gaming Club slot players find they like the casino far too much to stop playing once they have met the Welcome Bonus requirements. Assuming that will be the case with you, too, rest assured, your continued play will not go unrewarded Every
                            time you play, you earn loyalty points which can be accumulated and later redeemed for cash, but this is only the start of what you can look forward to as a regular Gaming Club player. This is one casino that really seems to go the extra mile
                            trying to keep all players happily entertained. Most online casinos do not even come close to offering such an exciting array of daily, weekly, and monthly promotions. Free spins, gadgets, cruises and vacations are up for grabs, and you do
                            not have to be a high roller to win them.</p>
                        <p>Since in most areas, this casino is very forthcoming about what players can expect in return for their action, we are surprised that more information is not provided on the website about the loyalty rewards you earn in addition based on your
                            play. Short of attaining VIP status, it is not clear how the point system works and whether the casino has tiered loyalty levels, each with its corresponding set of extra benefits. This is our only criticism of the casino’s loyalty program.
                            However, some players are eligible for additional midweek and weekend percentage match bonuses. You are notified by email if you qualify.</p>
                        <h3 class="title title--h4">VIP Programme</h3>
                        <p>Gaming Club Canada really rolls out the red carpet for its VIPs. If your play qualifies, expect to be treated like royalty. Your 5-star rewards will include all of the following.</p>

                        <h2 class="title title--h2">Game Variety</h2>
                        <p>Slots are no different from other casino games in that even long time personal favourites can start to become monotonous with repetitive play. That is why having a large number of games with lots of variety is so important to any regular slot
                            player. At Gaming Club, with more than 400 slots at your beck and call 24/7, even if you play every day, becoming bored is impossible. This is a casino with every variety of slot game imaginable, so if you are looking for a particular type
                            of slot and Gaming Club doesn’t offer it, then it probably does not even exist. Don’t rule it out though on a future visit because every month Microgaming releases new games and Gaming Club is one of the first places to get them. But the first
                            order of business is trying to decide what game to play right now, and that decision won’t be easy. A good place to start is to pick a category, which at Gaming Club can be any of the following.</p>
                        <h3 class="title title--h4">Classic Slots (Reel Slots)</h3>
                        <p>High tech slots with many paylines and nonstop action aren’t for everyone. If your tastes run towards simple slot machines, try the Gaming Club classic slots. Spectacular Wheel of Wealth, Cutesy Pie, and Oranges and Lemons are all popular with
                            Canadian online slots players.</p>
                        <h3 class="title title--h4">Fruit Machines</h3>
                        <p>Fruit machines are not only a big hit in the UK where they originated, but in Canada, too. If you have never played traditional pub style games like Cash ‘n Curry, Chavin it Large, and The Gee Gees, you might be pleasantly surprised.</p>
                        <h3 class="title title--h4">Video Slots</h3>
                        <p>If nothing less than state-of-the-art graphics, sounds, and animations will do, look no further than Gaming Club’s highly entertaining interactive video slots to provide hours of fun and thrills, along with many ways to win. Tomb Raider, Hellboy,
                            and the Dark Knight are just a few of the games that savvy Canadian slot players have made their favourite video slots.</p>
                        <h3 class="title title--h4">Progressive Slots</h3>
                        <p>Last, but certainly not least, you never know when it could be your lucky day to walk away with a life-changing sum of money on one of Microgaming’s multi-casino linked slot games. The three that Gaming Club players seem to love most are <a href="/games/mega-moolah" class="text--link">Mega
                            Moolah</a>, Major Millions, and Tunzamunni</p>
                        <p>If you are torn between several games and can’t make up your mind, no problem. Gaming Club will let you try out a game for free with play money, and later, when you are ready, switch to real money. Also, even if a mega-sized jackpot on the real
                            money games has eluded you, you can have just as much fun going after a small prize in the daily slot freerolls. Or, if you prefer, take a break from the slots and try your luck at another casino game like video poker, casino table poker,
                            or one of Gaming Club’s many variations of blackjack and roulette. If playing online is making you miss being in a real casino, we recommend the live dealer games. Playing blackjack, roulette, or baccarat with a Gaming Club live dealer is
                            probably as close as you can get to playing in a real casino without making the trip.</p>

                        <h2 class="title title--h2">Gaming Club Mobile</h2>
                        <p>The ability to play at a casino using a mobile device is now absolutely vital. In fact, users of
                            <a href="/mobile" class="text--link">mobile casinos</a>  are fast catching up with desktop users in terms of numbers. This means that every gambling site must offer a high-quality mobile casino experience – and this is something that Gaming Club achieves, albeit with one hitch.
                            This is a site that can be played using any mobile device, from iPhones through to Android, and from iPads through to Windows Phones, all the while retaining the same high level of enjoyment as the desktop site. There are two ways in which
                            to enjoy Gaming Club mobile on your device: you can either download the apps for different games, or alternatively access the casino via your browser. If you do the latter, you’ll find that the site has been redesigned to suit mobile users,
                            but has managed to retain much of the desktop experience.</p>
                        <p>The only major criticism to make of Gaming Club’s mobile casino is the fact that it is slightly short on games. While the desktop site has a staggering number to choose from, it seems that they’ve been slow to transfer these games across to
                            the mobile and tablet platform. Players will still be able to find some of their favourites when they play, such as Tomb Raider, Thunderstruck and Jacks or Better, however those with a real thirst for variety might not be too impressed. Games
                            are being added all the time though, so it shouldn’t be too long before the mobile casino has an impressive array of different titles for players to choose from.</p>
                        <p>As with most casinos, the bonuses available to players at Gaming Club mobile are pretty much in line with the bonuses available to other players, however keep your eyes open, as exclusive mobile bonuses could be a possibility. Security is also
                            an important topic to mention, and Gaming Club does a good job keeping their mobile players safe, although you should always exercise caution when playing using an unsecured network, especially if you are inputting personal information. Support
                            options are also good for smartphone players, which isn’t always the case at some other mobile casinos.

                        <p>As you can see, Canadian players have a wide range of banking options. Besides those listed here, there might be others; check with the casino directly about the particular method you have in mind. For your convenience, Gaming Club gladly accepts
                            C$ for all transactions. Most deposit methods can also be used for withdrawal and, speaking of withdrawal, here is more great news. Gaming Club players never have to wait long for their loonies. Withdrawals are much faster than the norm for
                            online casinos. Within 48 hours is the rule at this casino, not the exception, and even faster for VIPs. However, the security of your financial transactions is never compromised. Every player’s account is fully protected through the casino’s
                            use of advanced encryption technology. All players are also given the option to set deposit limits and review their on-site transaction and play history records.</p>

                        <p>Perhaps the most important thing that can be offered by any online casino isn’t the games, the depositing options, or the mobile experience (all of which happen to be good at Gaming Club Canada). Instead, it’s the feeling of trust when playing
                            there, and this is Gaming Club’s strongest point. As they’ve been around since the early 90s, you can be completely confident that you’re being treated in the correct way when signing up to this online casino, meaning that you’ll always be
                            able to play their many games with confidence. This is the main reason why Gaming Club has to be considered one of the better Canadian nline casinos around.</p>

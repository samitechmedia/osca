                    <p>We realized during our LeoVegas Casino online review that this is a site we’ll look back on someday and recognize it as the chief innovator of a new trend in online casino and slot gaming. Launched in 2012, LeoVegas Canada was one of the first
          &apos;mobile-first&apos; online casinos ever launched, and its impact on the scene has been huge, garnering multiple awards in the recent past such as Slots Operator of the Year and Mobile Casino Operator of the Year. As the future of pretty much everything
          online shifts to be more mobile-based, LeoVegas is showing itself to be ahead of the pack with its large selection of real money slot, live dealer, and table games that all run perfectly on mobile smartphones and tablet browsers and apps (as
          well as on regular computers). The Canadian site does have its own dedicated app for iOS, Android, BlackBerry, and Windows, although it’s certainly not required in order to play for real money (and many actually prefer to play it in-browser without
          downloading any apps).</p>
                    <ul class="bullet__list bullet--text">
                        <li class="bullet__item"><i class="fa fa-check" aria-hidden="true"></i>A relatively new site, but already highly trusted by players</li>
                        <li class="bullet__item"><i class="fa fa-check" aria-hidden="true"></i>Offers an exceedingly good mobile experience</li>
                        <li class="bullet__item"><i class="fa fa-check" aria-hidden="true"></i>New Canadian players receive a 200% welcome bonus, plus much more</li>
                        <li class="bullet__item"><i class="fa fa-check" aria-hidden="true"></i>Fully licenced by the Malta Gaming Authority</li>
                        <li class="bullet__item"><i class="fa fa-check" aria-hidden="true"></i>24/7 support available, via email, live chat, and phone</li>

                    </ul>
                    <p>With games from nine different developers (including arguably the industry&apos;s best in <a href="/software/microgaming">Microgaming</a>), a slew of welcome bonuses, and vivid graphics, LeoVegas truly offers something for all Canadian players. The quality LeoVegas Canada puts forth
          would be astounding just for a normal PC-first online casino, but the fact that you can enjoy this casino on the go in your Android, iPad, iPhone, Windows Phone, or other smartphone / tablet&apos;s browser or app makes LeoVegas something truly special.
          Everything you do on LV is backed by certification from two of the most respected gaming certification organizations in the world and the latest in data encryption technology, making LeoVegas online casino a no-brainer for all mobile online
          casino players.</p>

                        <p>Canadian LeoVegas players are welcomed to the site with real money bonuses on their first four deposits. Just by making your first deposit you will receive 200% back (up to C&dollar;100 in <a href="/real-money">real money</a>) to play with for free. The second and third deposits
                            match your deposits 100% (up to C&dollar;300), and the fourth deposit you make is a 50% return up to that same C&dollar;300 amount. LeoVeas Casino also runs regular special promotions for its returning players that offer even more free money, bonus spins, and
                            other fun prizes. While the details aren&apos;t listed on their site, LeoVegas Canada also has a VIP loyalty program that can reward you with similar free spin and real money prizes. Just be sure to always read the terms and conditions, as not
                            all bonus and rewards apply to Canadian players, unfortunately.</p>
                        <p>LeoVegas online casino carries operating licenses from both the United Kingdom&apos;s Gambling Commission and the <a href="https://www.mga.org.mt/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" class="text--link">Malta Gaming Authority</a>, two of the foremost authorities in online gambling regulation anywhere in the world. Receiving these certifications
                            is no easy task, as they are only given to online operators that meet a stringent list of quality standards (including using a balanced <a href="/guides/random-number-generators">Random Number Generator</a>) and follow good financial practices. This includes having strong transaction security
                            in place, such as the encryption technology that keeps your sensitive banking and personal information safe from would-be hackers. In the rare instance you should encounter any kind of issue while playing on LeoVegas, they offer 24/7 support
                            via email, live chat, and toll-free phone.</p>

                        <p>Even though it&apos;s far from the internet&apos;s biggest, LeoVegas still offers one of the best selections of online slots quality-wise that you&apos;ll find anywhere on the internet. Its 250 machines are organized neatly in alphabetical order and every
                            single one is optimized for perfect play on your smartphone, tablet, or other mobile device&apos;s browser or on the dedicated mobile app. If that number of choices is overwhelming to you, LeoVegas online casino also offers a list of its 20 most
                            popular games if you&apos;d just prefer to quickly hop on an option that you know is tried and true. Better yet, each game has a free play mode so you can try a slot before you wager any real money on it.</p>
                        <p>When doing our LeoVegas Casino review, we were also excited to see that the site offers a few <a href="/progressive-jackpots">progressive jackpots</a>, such as the popular Super Multitimes Progressive machine. Progressive slots are ones where the jackpot increases a little
                            bit after each spin (due to a small percentage taken from each paid wager) on either a single machine, or in many cases, many machines pooled together across the same gaming network. Progressive jackpots are awarded either at random or when
                            a special reel combination or event occurs on a spin. As you can probably imagine, these jackpots can regularly climb into the hundreds of thousands of dollars, if not millions. Regardless of whether you play on PC, on one of LeoVegas&apos; mobile apps,
                            or in your device&apos;s browser, you have the odds of winnings these mega real money jackpots.</p>

                        <p>Launched in 2012, LeoVegas was one of the first

                        <p>LeoVegas mobile is an example to all other online casinos about how smartphone and tablet play should be done. What seems like should be an easy task (making simple online games look good on smartphones and tablets) has given the industry fits
                            the past few years. Enter LeoVegas, which has stripped down their online gaming experience to the bare essentials, leaving what is a great mobile slots gaming experience for all Canadians that enjoy smartphone and tablet gambling.</p>

                        <p>LeoVegas is an online casino that pretty much offers everything to its players, with the only criticism being that it could have a few more games – although the ones it does have are all of the highest quality. It&apos;s a particularly great site
                            for those looking to play using their mobile, plus the bonuses are generous, as long as you check that Canadian players are eligible to receive them. So, when everything is considered, you could certainly do worse than playing at the LeoVegas

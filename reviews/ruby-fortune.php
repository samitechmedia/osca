                    <p>Ruby Fortune Casino was launched all the way back in the early days of online gambling (2003 to be exact) by the Palace Group. These guys operate several online casinos and it's no surprise - they've been doing a fantastic job. Ruby Fortune Canada
                    utilizes a bold and glamorous theme with a classic red on black colour scheme, but it's what's under the hood that really counts. Things like fantastic game play, better than average bonuses, and the reliability that comes with years of experience
                    and thousands of satisfied customers all add up to a winning package.</p>

					<div class="review__casino-block">
						<h2 class="title title--h2">Great Bonus &amp; Features</h2>
						<p>In addition to the welcome bonus (100% up toC$750), which applies to the first three deposits, Ruby Fortune casino also has a jackpot bonus. If you are the lucky winner of any jackpot worth C$25,000 or more, Ruby Fortune Casino will sweeten
							the deal by throwing an extra C$1000 into your winnings. Keep this in mind if you're looking at a big jackpot and trying to decide if it's worth playing for. Also, even if you aren't pulling down the top prizes, you will receive player points
							through their loyalty program just for playing. As these pile up, you can turn them into cash back rewards: win or lose.</p>
						<p>The Microgaming software that's in place at Ruby Fortune Canada is typically trusted, but they still go the extra mile to let know that they are being honest. Third party testing firms regularly inspect the software download used to power the
							random number generator and verify that the published payout percentages are accurate. Additionally, as a licensed casino operator working out of Malta, you have a good sense that these people can be held accountable for any bad behaviour.
							Best of all, if you want more information about this, or if you have any problems, you can take advantage of their live support, 24/7, by logging into their live chat, sending them an email, or even calling one of their toll free support numbers!</p>

						<h2 class="title title--h2">Mobile</h2>
						<p>Having the ability to offer players a great mobile experience is vital these days, and this is something that Ruby Fortune certainly does well. Their casino can be accessed by mobile players of all types, including those playing using the iPhone
							and iPad, as well as those playing using an Android or BlackBerry device. Android users will especially like playing at Ruby Fortune, as theyâ€™ll be able to download a number of games created by software giant Microgaming. These are all relatively
							small, so can be downloaded quickly, especially when using a faster internet connection. Perhaps the most popular game for Ruby Fortune mobile players in Canada is Mega Millions, which is a progressive slot usually offering an absolutely huge
							jackpot. All mobile games also have the same level of fairness as those found on the desktop site, and come with the prestigious eCOGRA certification.</p>
						<p>The Ruby Fortune mobile casino also supports multiple payment methods, each of which are protected by advanced encryption technology. This means that players can deposit and withdraw with confidence when using the mobile site. Some of the more
							popular depositing methods used at the mobile casino include credit/debit card, Instadebit and PayPal. When depositing, keep an eye out for any exclusive bonuses, as they are regularly offered by this casino. You should look at the wagering
							requirements as well though, as Ruby Fortune are known for having higher requirements than many other sites.</p>
						<p>The only other thing to say about the smartphone and tablet experience at Ruby Fortune mobile casino is this: the whole layout of the mobile casino is fantastic. It not only looks great (which is a highly underrated aspect of any casino), but
							also feels incredibly intuitive, allowing players to navigate the site with absolute ease. Some other casinos occasionally feel slightly difficult to use, and they could certainly learn a thing or two from Ruby Fortune mobile.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="review__casino-block">
						<h2 class="title title--h2">Deposit Options</h2>
						<p>So, what can you expect from the depositing process at Ruby Fortune? Well, thereâ€™s a really large range of
							<a href="/deposit/" class="text--link">different options</a>  for players to choose from, including credit/debit cards, e-wallets (including PayPal and Neteller), and prepaid cards (Skrill and Paysafecard). Some will also choose to pay using an e-check, however these usually take
							a long time to process, meaning that games canâ€™t be played instantly. Depositing is safe, thanks to the great encryption technology employed by the site, and most depositing options also lead to money in your account instantly. Players are
							easily able to restrict the amount that they deposit at the site, which can be a really useful feature for more impulsive players.</p>
						<p>Withdrawals are equally as easy as deposits, however some of the depositing options canâ€™t be used for it. These include Skrill and Paysafecard. It is generally the rule that withdrawals will need to be made using the same method as you deposited
							with, however when this isnâ€™t possible, an alternative withdrawal option will need to be used. As already mentioned in this review, ensure you check the withdrawal requirements for bonuses though, as they can be quite high at Ruby Fortune.</p>
						<p>Unlike some Canadian online casinos, Ruby Fortune supports C$ as a currency, meaning that you wonâ€™t need to play around with exchange rates every time you deposit or withdraw funds. None of the depositing options will incur a charge, and the
							minimum that can be deposited is generally C$20.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="review__casino-block">
						<h2 class="title title--h2">Casino Games Offered</h2>
						<p>Ruby Fortune offers over 450 Flash casino games, which include the many different varieties of classic games like progressive jackpots, slots (3 and 5 reel), roulette, blackjack, craps, sic bo, baccarat, video poker, and many more, all available
							to download! All of these are powered by&nbsp;Microgaming, which means they come packaged with the legendary quality and fairness that the brand has become known for on both PC and mobile with apps. Just head to their website via desktop,
							Mac, smartphone, mobile or tablet app on iOS for iPad and iPhone or Android to take these games for a free test drive!</p>
					</div>
					<div class="review__casino-block">
						<h2 class="title title--h2">Conclusion</h2>
						<p>If youâ€™re looking for a well-regarded, trustworthy and nicely designed online casino in Canada, Ruby Fortune might well be the choice for you. While the bonus requirements are sometimes high, the many other great features â€“ including the huge
							selection of games, variety of depositing methods and great customer service â€“ all make up for this. The mobile version of the site is also an absolute pleasure to use, and should really please Canadian gamblers who like to play at a casino
							while on the go.</p>

    <h2 class="title title--h2">Enjoy 100s Of Casino Games</h2>
    <p>
      We get it. You've come to <a href="/">OnlineSlots.ca</a> because you love playing slot machines, and you want to find the best <a href="/real-money">real money slots</a> or <a href="/free">free slots</a>. But sometimes you want to enjoy a game other than slot machines. Sometimes, you've got the Blackjack, Baccarat, or Roulette itch. Don't worry about finding a separate place to play. Your favourite online casino slots site has all the popular games.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most of our picks offer well over 150 Internet gambling games (in many cases, that number hits closer to 300). For the most part, you can play regular online casino slots (like those old-school 3-reel games), real money slots with bonus rounds, and progressive jackpot slots. You can also hit the felt at the best Internet betting sites in Canada and enjoy Craps, Casino War, Baccarat, Blackjack, and anything else you'll find at the top Canada casinos. Online, you'll also find video poker and even Keno.
    </p>
    <h2 class="title title--h2">Play For Real Money in C$</h2>
    <p>
      The good thing about playing at a C$ online casino is that you don't have to worry about having your credit card declined. Every one of the real money online Canadian casino sites lets you deposit in Canadian dollars using your Visa, MasterCard,
      or Amex. You can also use other <a href="/deposit/" class="text--link">deposit methods</a>  like Skrill, UseMyBank, and a number of others. Depositing usually takes just a few minutes the first time you fund your account. Each subsequent time is even faster.
    </p>
    <h2 class="title title--h2">We've rated top Canadian online slots casinos</h2>
    <p>
      We hate smoke and mirrors more than anything else.

And believe us. As Canadians who love to play <a href="/games/">slot games</a>, we've come across our fair share of those sites.
    </p>

                      Kind of. What we mean is that YOU are free to enjoy them until your hearts content. However operators must use off shore servers to provide these and, depending on where the gaming servers are situated, it is perfectly legal. The majority of these are based on Kahnawake native reserve near Montreal so there is no need to worry. Increasingly however, due to <a href="https://uk.practicallaw.thomsonreuters.com/" class="text--link" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Canada's provincial jurisdiction</a>, provinces are passing laws to provide online gambling themselves.

                      Canadian online casinos work across all modern devices. Both <a href="/mobile">mobile slots</a> and online casinos</a> work for both Android and Apple devices. There really has never been a better time to play with greater choices. All of the above offer direct applications however Mac users, although catered for, are better off with a no download, instant play option.

                      Well, I'm sure you don't need telling but slots, online or in house machine, can't offer odds so to seek out your best shot at a win you need to look elsewhere. In most casinos, the house edge is just one percent meaning Blackjack generally offers the best odds of winning. Craps also offers a reasonable chance of a return, while roulette can allow for a 50/50 chance of a win should player stick to betting on red or black.

                      Roulette can offer you a 50/50 shot at getting a win if you pick on colours instead of numbers while craps and blackjack allow you a good chance of a win too. As for slots, all odds are non-quantifiable and random instead but, with progressive Jackpots, offer excellent financial rewards.

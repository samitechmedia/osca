            <p>When it comes to playing slot games for iPad, Apple tablet owners
                have it made. While they may not own an iPad slots casino, nor
                run an Internet poker room, they are providing the hardware for
                online gambling fans in Canada to enjoy their favourite casino
                games. And the iPad online slots software developers are slowly
                catching up.</p>

            <p>In <?php echo date('Y'); ?>, the Apple iPad is blazing a trail
                for
                online
                casino players in Canada to play the best slots around. Not only
                that, the app store offers a whole host of places where players
                can enjoy free slots games, too. So, where should you be
                depositing your CA currency? Have a look at the top recommended
                sites we've picked out on this page.</p>

            <h2 class="title title--h2">iPad Slots - Game The Future With Apple
                Tablets</h2>
            <p>All the slots apps we have recommended offer most of the same
                games a regular online casino has, but some offer specific
                options for your iPad tablet. That means you won't be squinting
                at the screen to play a no download version of Thunderstruck II
                or Cleopatra, but rather enjoy a special app for iPad, designed
                just for your iOS device.</p>

            <p>With tablet software advancing at a frightening pace, it makes
                sense to take advantage if you're an Apple iPad user in <?php
                echo date('Y'); ?>.
                The latest Apple devices boast top-end graphics, faster
                processors, and longer lasting batteries so you can enjoy the
                ultimate in casino games on the go.</p>

            <h2 class="title title--h2">A Simple and Quick Guide</h2>
            <p>While we may be getting ahead of ourselves in suggesting all your
                favourite online slots are available for your Canadian tablet,
                there are literally hundreds of games available for Canuck
                players right now – and all for real money.</p>

                today by logging into a Canadian online casino via your tablet's

                up valuable space on your iPad's hard drive - simply choose one

                you go. You can then enjoy games on your iPad's advanced screen,

            <h2 class="title title--h2">Play iPad Online Slots Anytime,
                Anywhere</h2>
            <p>The best part of playing real money slots and slot games for iPad

                and start playing great slots games. That's one advantage
                desktop users DON'T have.</p>

            <h2 class="title title--h2">Safety with Slots Apps</h2>
            <p>As with all aspects of using your iPad for everyday life, make
                sure you're up to date on your anti-virus software. After all,
                you don't want to access gaming sites or download clients that
                may infect your tablet.</p>

            <p>By finding you the safest places to enjoy online slots in Canada,
                you can rest assured you're playing at a respected Internet slot

                falling into the wrong hands. We test every site for safety –
                follow our top guide today.</p>

            <h2 class="title title--h2">Your Gambling App With One Tap</h2>
            <p>One of the biggest gripes from online slots iPad users in Canada
                is that most online casinos for Apple devices need to be
                accessed through Safari or another web browser. On a Mac or PC,
                accessing your casino is as easy as double clicking an icon on
                the desktop. But that's not the case when the casino is accessed
                through the web on an Apple iPad.</p>

            <p>Fortunately, there's a great way to create an iPad gambling
                shortcut. While you're on the casino slots site sign-in page,
                click the little rectangle with the arrow jumping out of it.
                You'll find it next to the search bar in Safari. Then, click the
                'Add to Home Screen' button, give the site a name, and click
                'Add'. You'll now have your own online slots casino app for your
                iPad that can be accessed with just one tap.</p>

            <h2 class="title title--h2">We Find the Best iPad Online Slots</h2>
            <p>Because of the larger screen size of the iPad and iPad mini
                compared to the iPhone, you might be tempted to try any online
                slots iPad site that works on your PC or Mac. However, not all
                online gambling sites are created equal.</p>

            <p>Luckily, we are here to help. Our experts rate, test and compare
                hundreds of online casinos for Canadians to make sure your slots
                needs are taken care of.</p>

            <p>Click on one of our top links to find yourself a great casino to
                play on your iPad in Canada. We'll even tell you which websites

            <h2 class="title title--h2">Free Slot Games for iPad</h2>
            <p>Playing real money games is a great way for players to experience
                the true thrill of online slots. This, however, is not
                applicable to everyone. Many Apple users prefer free slot games
                for iPad as opposed to playing for real money. We understand
                that not all users are ready to jump in with real money yet and
                so we recommend looking into free slot games for iPad devices to
                get up to scratch. For those who are just making their way onto
                the scene and want to ease into it at their own pace are advised
                to start with free slots. The sites we recommend will provide
                the best free slot games for iPad devices so you can enjoy the
                best gaming experience.</p>

                        <p>Although iOS devices such as iPhone and iPad
                            generally won't run flash media, most mobile casinos
                            have bypassed this by developing their own games for
                            iOS. Realizing the huge popularity of the iPhone and
                            iPad, casinos have ensured that their gaming
                            software is compatible with almost every version
                            Apple's mobile offerings. Just as well because the
                            gaming potential on iPad is limitless. Mobile
                            casinos are reliant on the specific iOS device to
                            run iOS3.x or a later version for compatibility.
                            This means devices with iOS5.x and iOS6.x will work.

    <h2 class="title title--h2">Survey the Payment Methods</h2>
    <p>
      Every casino has a list of the payment methods it supports. When you want to cash out you'll have to know which method you want to use to get your money. Some casinos have more methods than others, but you should know what those methods are when you get started. Take a look at the list before you decide that you're at the best payout online casino available, because you could be horribly wrong.
    </p>
    <h2 class="title title--h2">Electronic Payments are the Best</h2>
    <p>
      I shouldn't matter if you love bank transfers, or if you're accustomed to receiving cheques for things. The fact is, electronic payment methods like Neteller and POLi are superior to the other options. They're faster for one thing, but they'll often cost you less money as well. You can get your money in a matter of hours or even minutes when you work with an instant payout casino and use one of these methods, and you'll probably only pay a very small amount of money in fees for the service. That's it, and you'll get your money out so that you can use it.
    </p>
    <h2 class="title title--h2">Supported Payment Methods</h2>
    <p>Here are the most common supported withdrawal methods by popular casinos.</p>

                Making a withdrawal is as easy as signing into your account and going into your balance and requesting to withdraw your money. You'll have to decide how you want to be paid and how much you want to take out, but that's it. The money should then be sent to you.

                You can't expect a specific amount of time without knowing the withdrawal method you're using. Cheques and other paper methods can take weeks, bank transfers take several days and simple electronic methods can be completed in hours to one or two days.

          <div class="accordion__content">
              <p>
                Online casinos send out the money using one of the supported methods they have. It could be through a Skrill or POLi payment, or it could be through a prepaid Visa or MasterCard or a cheque. It all depends on what is supported at the location.

              <p>
                The option is only important if you're worried about the time it takes to get the money or the fee that you have to pay. Most methods will get you your money, but some will cost you more and take more of your time up in the process. Cheques tend to take longest and cost the most, electronic transfers are the fastest and most economical of the bunch.

                Of course you care what your payout amount is when withdrawing money, but did you know that casinos do as well? They will only let you take money if you have enough of it, and only certain withdrawal options are available to you if you don't have a large enough balance.

                Only a few casinos will let you take money out with no real minimum, most require a certain level of real money to complete the transaction. When you work with an instant payout casino, or any casino known for quick payouts you'll have to have enough money to withdraw it out. It's best you know what that amount is.

              <p>
                The casinos with the fastest payouts are the ones that support electronic payments without much "processing time". Look at casinos to see what their payout claims are and you'll quickly see that some are much faster than others, and the fast ones support things like Skrill and UKash.

          <div class="accordion__content">
              <p>
                You get some regulation in casino payouts, but only to a small extent in Canada. Each casino is monitored to ensure they are secure and that they are fair and safe to use. Other than that the money that is paid out isn't paid much attention to. You'll get your money and won't be expected to pay taxes on it. This isn't the case in every country, but it is in Canada.

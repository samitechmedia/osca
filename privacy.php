                cookies we use on our Website, and what they are used for:</p>

            <ul class="bullet__list--plain">
                <li>'Session cookies' – this is a kind of cookie, which is created
                    as you enter a website, and it is only kept for as long as your
                    browser is still open. Session cookies facilitate the smooth
                    operation of our Services. If you switch them off, our Website
                    may become slower and less responsive.
                </li>
                <li>'Persistent cookies' – this is the other main type of cookie,
                    which is kept for longer periods of time, usually a year, though
                    that depends on the privacy policy of the Website that is producing
                    them. The Company does not make use of persistent cookies. Some of
                    our third-party affiliates use them as a way of monitoring and
                    studying users' behavior on our Website. Please note that our affiliates'
                    privacy policies are their own and we have no control over them.
                    There are several types of persistent cookies, which all have varying functions:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Functionality cookies – this type of cookie is what differentiates
                            users from each other, so each user's choices can be saved, leading
                            to better website performance;
                        </li>
                        <li>who access the Website and analyses their general behavior there,
                            including what tabs they click on or what links they follow.
                            This information is then used to reorganize the Website to a more
                            user-friendly design; and
                        </li>
                        <li>Targeting cookies – this type of cookie is like a history of the
                            pages and links user’s access, which helps us make the Website
                            more relevant to the users' interests.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>Your continued patronage of the Website and its Services is taken as your
                acknowledgment and consent to the use of the above types of cookies and

                third-party websites separately, as any risks emerging from accessing third-party
                websites are knowingly and willingly carried by the user.</p>

            <p>Data that you share with a third-party website that you have accessed via a hyperlink
                on our Website is not covered by our Privacy Policy. Our Privacy Policy is solely
                applicable to the Website.</p>

            <h2 class="title title--h2">Using your information</h2>

            <p>We may use the non-personal data we gather from you for a number of different purposes,
                some of which have already been listed in this Privacy Policy. We may also use it for
                the following purposes:</p>

            </ul>

            <p>We are also entitled to provide collected non-personal data to relevant parties
                in answer to government requests, court demands or requests by similar legal
                organizations, as long as these follow the applicable laws and regulations.</p>

            <h2 class="title title--h2">Sharing your information</h2>

            <p>There are several different reasons why we may provide your non-personal data to
                outside parties. These are described below, divided according to the party the
                information is shared with:</p>

            <h3 class="title title--h3">Third-party service providers</h3>

            <p>Your non-personal information may be provided to some of our business affiliates
                so that they can proceed with their data-analyzing tasks, whose goal is to improve
                our Website. Their tasks consist of:</p>

            <ul class="bullet__list--plain">
                <li>Supplying promotional content to you, our user; and</li>
                <li>Collecting, processing and diagnosing information and the performance of the Website.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The information that we provide to our third-party partners is treated in the same way as we
                treat your data internally, following the processing and security measures listed in this
                Privacy Policy and obeying all relevant laws.</p>

            <h3 class="title title--h3">Other disclosures</h3>

            <p>Other entities that may be given restricted access to your non-personal data may include our
                advisers, auditors, and any potential buyers and investors in our Company. Your data may also
                be accessible to our third-party partners and subsidiaries where this will lead to an enhanced
                performance of the Website.</p>

            <p>If the Company becomes part of a merger, a large business share transaction, or the purchase of
                a business or asset, it may also share your data with the parties that will be involved in such
                corporate dealings.</p>

            <p>Apart from the above situations, the Company may also share your data if it is found to be required
                in order to comply with a legal obligation, governmental query or relevant law; if it is believed
                to be helping to enforce any legal rights such as those of intellectual property; if it will help
                to cooperate in taking legal action against illegal transactions, such as security concerns and
                probably fraud; and as a way to endorse our internal policies, exercise our right to contesting
                legal claims, and preserving the security of the rights of the Company, its users, and its third-party affiliates.</p>

            <h2 class="title title--h2">Information retention</h2>

            <p>Your non-personal data is only stored while you are using our Services, followed by the expiration
                of the legal period demanded by our policies for sake of your security and our observance of the
                relevant laws. When you share your data with us, you also consent to our Privacy Policy and the
                methods it describes for collecting and processing your data. All reasonable efforts are then made
                to ensure that your data is always safe and secure as per all the conditions that are listed in
                our Privacy Policy.</p>

            <p>We do not accept responsibility for any outdated information that is provided to us.</p>

            <h2 class="title title--h2">Security and transfer of information</h2>

            <p>We spend a lot of time and effort on ensuring that both the users and the Company are sufficiently
                safe and secure by monitoring our safety procedures closely. We follow the industry-wide playbook
                of security measures to secure information transfers and to prevent any unauthorized access to our
                users' information. Since we endeavor to take all reasonably necessary steps to ensure the safety
                of our users' data, we do not take any responsibility if there are any data leaks or exploitation
                of our Services.</p>

            <p>While we do our utmost to provide users with trustworthy transaction methods and to store information
                in a secure manner, the security of transmissions over the internet cannot be guaranteed by us, and
                so the risk of any such transaction is carried solely by the user.</p>

            <p>The Company is an international organization that spans beyond the European Union (the "EU"), and as
                such is monitored by laws originating from several different countries. Occasionally your non-personal
                information may have to cross country and EU lines to and through areas where the data protection and
                gaming laws are not as comprehensive as those within the EU. In such situations, the Company will
                endeavor to provide your data with an equivalent level of protection and security no matter which
                laws it falls under at that moment. When you provide us with your data, you also give us your informed
                acknowledgment and consent to our processing of your data according to the procedures described in this
                Privacy Policy.</p>

            <h2 class="title title--h2">Minors</h2>

                are geared towards users that are above the age of 18.</p>

            <h2 class="title title--h2">Privacy Policy updates</h2>

            <p>We strongly advise you to regularly review this Privacy Policy in order to be aware of any updates that
                may be done to it, which will be carried out whenever the Company considers them necessary. You will

                out any major changes to the Privacy Policy, we will inform you immediately through our newsletter or

            <p>Your continued patronage of our Website and Services after a notification of Privacy Policy update is
                considered equal to your informed consent of such changes.</p>

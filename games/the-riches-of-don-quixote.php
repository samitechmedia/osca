            <p>The legend of Don Quixote is well known and well loved around the world. Don Quixote is a novel by Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra from the 17th century. It tells the tale of Don Quixote, who is on a mission to revive chivalry and bring justice to
        the world, which in his eyes is sorely needed. He sees himself as a knight and hires a farmer as his squire and they go on comedic adventures together in the country side. Don Quixote is mad, and sees inns as castles, windmills as giants and friars
        for wizards. In The Riches of Don Quixote slots, you get to play along with these adventures as you rack up cash winnings. </p>
      <p>The Riches of Don Quixote features increasing multipliers, frozen wilds, free spins, stacked symbols and regular wilds. The graphics are artistic and beautiful and it really gives you the feeling of being on the Spanish countryside with Don himself.
        This slots game features 25 paylines, and always pays out the maximum win per payline. Winning combinations are awarded from left to right.</p>

        <?php echo getCasinoBlockHTML('therichesofdonquixote', 'game-images'); ?>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>The stacked symbols in this game are the armored hat, the shield and spears, the Ace, the King, the Queen and the jack. These six symbols are stacked 2-high on the reels, which gives you even more potential for winning.&nbsp; The stacked symbols
    will appear as one long image that occupies two reel positions. If you can line up some of the higher value stacked symbols on the reels, you can win really big prizes.</p>
    <p>The biggest bonus feature in The Riches of Don Quixote is the La Mancha Free Games feature. When you spin three or more Don Quixote books anywhere on the five reels, you will be automatically rewarded with 10 free spins. Not only that, there is
    also an increasing multiplier that goes along with the 10 free spins. You start off with a 2x multiplier, and this goes up by one value after every two free spins. This means that on your third and fourth free spin, you have a 3x multiplier.
    On your 5
    <sup>th</sup> and 6
    <sup>th</sup> free spin, you have a 4x multiplier. Spins 7 and 8 have a 5x multiplier, and on your final two spins you get a massive 6x multiplier! You can see how this has the potential to increase your winnings significantly in a very short period
    of time.</p>
    <p>As if that wasn't enough, the windmill acts ad an extra wild symbol during your free spins. The windmill automatically appears in the middle of the third reel for the entire length of the free spins feature. This is called a frozen wild, and it
      will substitute for any other symbol while you are playing your free spins. With stacked symbols, double wilds and up to 6x multipliers, this free spins feature is like nothing else out there right now.</p>
    <p>The 3,000 coin jackpot in The Riches of Don Quixote can seem disappointing to some people. It is not a progressive jackpot, and there are some other online slots games out there that feature jackpots that are much higher, even up to 125,000 coins
    or more. But, a smaller than average jackpot is really not a negative thing when you consider how many chances you have to win in this game. Games with huge jackpots often do not have very exciting bonus features, and you have to play for a
    really long time at the max bet in order to even have a chance at the jackpot. In The Riches of Don Quixote, you have the chance to win smaller amounts of money way more often, which in the end usually comes out in your favour. You can The Riches
          of Don Quixote for hours and stack up wins without breaking the bank.</p>

            five options and sometimes force you to bet a dollar or more every time you spin. The total bet depends on how many paylines you want to play. It makes sense to always play the maximum 25 paylines, because you will always have the most chances
            to win every time you spin. the reels. But, if you are betting a higher range this can get expensive quick. Since the jackpot is not progressive or based on the amount of your line bet, it is a good idea to bet the max paylines at a lower level,
            instead of betting higher amounts on fewer paylines. You may not win as much at one time, but you will win far more often and the winnings will add up in the end.</p>

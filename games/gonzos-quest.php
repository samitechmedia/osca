              <p>
                One of the best and most popular real money online slots in the world, Gonzo's Quest transports players
                from Canada to the coast of Peru. The game begins in 1541 when Spanish conquistador Gonzalo Pizarro
                steals the map to El Dorado and sneaks away
                from his ship under the cover of darkness.</p>
              <p>
                You may not find the fabled city of gold, but the road to El Dorado can still net online slots players
                in Canada a bounty worthy of the conquistadors. The biggest jackpot prize in the Gonzo's Quest online
                slot is C&dollar;112,500 and the awesome avalanche
                feature will routinely award multipliers of up to 15 times your win.

<h2 class="title title--h2">Gonzo’s Quest Review: The History</h2>

<p>The award-winning Gonzo’s Quest online slot takes its name from the Spanish conquistador Gonzalo Pizarro, who’s quest was to find the legendary Country of Cinnamon. Like El Dorado, the City of Gold, this was a place of vast riches that the “New

  World” had hidden for European explorers to discover.</p>

<p>You may think that Gonzo, who is ever-present by the reels as you play this slot, doesn’t look like the typical dashing hero that you find in many online slots. That’s because Gonzo was a ruthless conquistador, who betrayed the King of Spain when

  the monarch attempted to protect the natives of the lands that Gonzo was pillaging. He was beheaded for treason – but we won’t let that affect our review.</p>

<h2 class="title title--h2">Avalanche Reels &amp; Big Slots Multipliers</h2>

<p>Gonzo’s Quest is an Aztec-themed online slot, with reels full of carved stone faces deep in the jungles of South America. Our eponymous conquistador is ever-present by the reels, and the slick graphics are top-notch.</p>

<p>However, we wouldn’t be giving a full Gonzo’s Quest review without mentioning that the standout feature of these awesome-looking reels is the Avalanche effect, which is not only really cool to look at but can also award a big real money win to

  players. It’s aesthetically cool because the reels all tumble down from above (like an avalanche of symbols) instead of spinning like a typical online slot.</p>

<p>

  It’s cool for your online slots bankroll, too. Each time you hit a winning payline combination, the winning symbols will crumble away and new symbols will fall down in their place. This can continue indefinitely until there are no more winning

  combinations left.

            <?php echo getCasinoBlockHTML('gonzoquest', 'game-images'); ?>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>On top of that, each additional Avalanche win carries an ever-increasing multiplier. Your second consecutive
          Avalanche will multiply your win by two; your third by three and your fourth by five. Any further Avalanche
          wins continue carrying a multiplier
          of five.</p>

            <h2 class="title title--h2">The Road to Golden Free Spins</h2>
            <p>During your journey from Canada to the depths of the Peruvian jungle, you might need a helping hand or
              two. This comes to you in the shape of free spins, which are called Free Falls in the game.</p>
            <p>If you manage to land three of the Free Fall symbols during regular spins, then you'll be treated to 10
              free spins at your current stake. You can even re-trigger the free spins feature as you play for
              potentially more winnings, and the Avalanche
              multipliers increase during Free Fall spins.</p>
            <h2 class="title title--h2">Gonzo's Quest Online Review: Our Verdict</h2>
            <p>To conclude this online slots review, we have to simply say that there's a reason that Gonzo's Quest is
              one of <a href="/software/netent">NetEnt</a>'s best online slots. It definitely gives you fantastic bang
              for your buck, and with a jackpot of over C$100,000 it's got potential
              prizes that are not to be sniffed at.</p>
            <p>A combination of the unique Avalanche feature, a frequently-triggered free spins round, and awesome
              graphics make this game well worth playing for any online slots fans in Canada and indeed around the
              world.</p>

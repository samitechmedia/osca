                        <p>You'll feel as though you're taking a seat in a packed poker hall when you load up Kings of Chicago. The soundtrack features a steady stream of background chatter that gives the impression of being in a bustling casino at the centre of the
                            action. As the cards are laid out on the table, traditional poker combinations are what you're looking for in order to win real money returns. Alongside the suited deck, you'll also see cards featuring mobsters with guns, dapper gents drinking,
                            and some fine fillies dressed to the nines. While poker chips, loose diamonds, and pistols surround the table edge, contributing to the gangster vibe.</p>
                        <h2 class="title title--h2">Play In Prohibition Era Chicago</h2>
                        <p>Kings of Chicago slots casino takes place in the 1920's prohibition era, with the main slot game itself being staged as if sitting at a poker table at the crux of a tense and high stakes game with some irrefutable characters for company. Rather
                            than spin like traditional slot reels, in Kings of Chicago, the symbols are playing cards and they spread out in rows on the table as if being dealt. This is a nice touch keeping in with the theme, and fans of poker itself may also find
                            they enjoy this online video slot because of the association with the popular casino card game.</p>
                        <p>You can adjust the bet level between 1-10, which in turn alters the value of the coin you wager accordingly. The highest end of the scale sees you playing with the maximum 50-coin stake, which you can also do by hitting the 'max bet' button
                            at any time.</p>
                        <p>Random scatters can appear at any time, and on any card. Find 3 of these anywhere on the table and you'll unlock the free deals feature where payline wins are subject to a x2 multiplier. If, during the free deals, you draw another 3 scatters,
                            a new free deals allocation will be awarded.</p>

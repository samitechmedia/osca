                        <h2 class="title title--h2">The Overview, Set Up and Jackpots</h2>
                        <p>This five reel, 20 line slot has two bonus games, and the chance to win an incredible progressive jackpot. With a huge devoted following, the growth of the progressive is astronomically fast. It suits any budget, as you have the chance to bet
                            from 0.01 to 1.00 per line, meaning that you can only bet up to 20 per spin coins per spin, however, you can set the amount you would like the coin value to be worth. This allows all people with a wide range of budgets to be involved. Considering
                            that there's a progressive jackpot that starts at 400,000 and can reach far into the millions mark, there's no lack of prizes to be won. The other, Slightly Less Holy Grail Jackpot beings it's progressive climb from around 100, and as you can
                            imagine, this jackpot is emptied far more regularly.</p>
                        <h2 class="title title--h2">Symbols</h2>
                        <p>The lower paying symbols in this game range from the standard 10 through to Ace, however what you really want to look out for is the face symbols. The high value symbols include character avatars from the musical – the fair Lady of the Lake, Sir
                            Robin and Sir Lancelot, and the man himself, King Arthur. Within the base game, Arthur provides you with the biggest win. You need five of him along an active payline and you will will 600 coins. While it's not progressive jackpot levels, its
                            still a tidy sum for a base game prize.</p>
                        <h2 class="title title--h2">How to Gain Entry to the Bonus Rounds</h2>
                        <p>In order to enter into the free spins round you need to score three Scatter symbols. If you manage to hit 5 Holy Grail symbols in the middle reel you will be entered into the bonus game. This has six levels to progress through, with the final
                            round giving you the chance to win the Holy Grail Jackpot, or the Slightly Less Holy Grail Jackpot. Be careful though, because at any moment you might be crushed between the weight of an enormous foot, eliminating you from that round of play.</p>

                        <p>There are also 4 different bonus games. These are activated by spinning the bonus symbol into both the first and final reel. They appear in a set order, with ascending cash prize reward value, so it's worth sticking it out. The first bonus feature
                            is called “Storm the Castle”. You have to choose between six prizes. Then the Knights shuffle them up and your prize is revealed. During this round, based on the famous French castle scene, a Frenchman will be launching cows at you. If you are
                            squashed by the bovine beast, your round is over and you return to the base game.</p>
                        <p>The second bonus game is called “None Shall Pass” that begins with a generous 5 x multiplier where you attempt to hack a limb off the Ridiculously Brave Night. The third game visits the “Knights Who Say Ni”, this operates as a kind of auction.
                            You sell a shrub to the Knights and they offer you a cash prize. However, if you think the next will be higher, you can risk it and ask for the following one. Bear in mind you only get 4 chances! The final and best bonus game is the “Killer
                            Rabbit Bonus.” You need to try to navigate your night safely across the rocks, without being eaten by the killer rabbit. Of course, the further you progress, the bigger and better your rewards will be.</p>
                        <h2 class="title title--h2">Our Experts Say</h2>
                        <p>While this game isn't for everyone, it certainly has its dedicated fans. It's not overly rewarding in the base games, but the side bonus games and features are a lot of fun, and the progressive jackpot keeps it tempting, for both high and low
                            rollers.</p>

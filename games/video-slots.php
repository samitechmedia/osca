      For nearly one hundred years after the invention of the first slots machine, all slots games operated by using reels that actually spun around to form winning combinations. These classic games still exist, but they have been eclipsed in a big way by video slot machines. In fact, in almost any modern casino (and all online casinos), you will be presented with an overwhelming majority of video slots. This should come as no surprise as players demand them and casinos have their own reasons for using the newest technology available. Read on as we look at how video slot games work, what makes them different than classic reel games, and how you can start playing them online today!

        <h2 class="title title--h2">The Origins of Video Slots</h2>
        <p>
          Video slots have a lot in common with traditional reel slots. The primary difference, though, is that there are not actually any spinning reels - just a computer screen that simulates them. To keep things fair, video slots games use <a href="/guides/random-number-generators">random number generators</a> (RNG's) to make sure that each spin of the reel is totally random, and third party auditing firms help to ensure that this is the case. As long as you are playing with a reliable operator, you should feel totally comfortable playing video slot game, whether online or in a brick and mortar casino.
        </p>
        <p>
          This high-tech digital design might seem like a superficial difference, but with a computer behind the scenes, video slot machines are capable of doing much, much more than their mechanical predecessors. For example, there are machines with as many as fifty paylines, and special bonus games that don't rely upon the reel format at all! There aren't any mechanical slots games out there that can compete with that! This level of flexibility allows players to experience a totally different gaming experience, usually with all of the bells and whistles in place. When you are playing video slot games, expect things like scatter symbols, bonus multipliers, wild symbols, and <a href="/progressive-jackpots" class="text--link">progressive jackpots!</a>
        </p>
        <h2 class="title title--h2">The Future Of Online Video Slots</h2>
        <p>
          With more than a handful of features that traditional reel slots cannot compete with, video slots have already secured their place in the future of casino gambling. The only question is how much they will replace the classic games. While nostalgia will probably prevent the complete demise of mechanical reel slots, video slot games are sure to take hold of an ever larger part of the market for years to come. They are simply much more advanced and flexible. Don't be surprised if you see video slots take over the industry in just the next few years, especially as they are the only workable option for online casinos.

              Video slots are merely a different way of presenting the same game. The difference being the traditional reels have been replaced by a computer screen that simulates them. The internals are largely unchanged with the game's main purpose still
              hinging on the Random Number Generators (RNG).

                Video slots still rely on RNG's to oversee the action so, on the inside, not much has changed from how the lines form. On the outside though, a shiny new screen preplaces the reels, but does the same job with extra benefits.

                The switch to digital has allowed for greater potential with, much like online slots, many games offering up to fifty pay lines. Also, without the reliance on reels, slot games can now offer bonus rounds, scatter and wild symbols previously unimaginable.

                Yes, they still have big jackpots. Bigger and better in fact. Like the online slot games, the newer computerized screen variants can offer more pay lines, thus bigger wins!

                You win just the same as before, by lining up a winning combination of symbols. The standard gameplay is the same as it has always been and winning lines are formed in the same random way.

                            <p>When was the last time you played a slot game that was so much fun it had you laughing out loud? If it has been a while, you owe it to yourself to try Karate Pig. Yes, the theme is ridiculous and, yes, skeptics criticize it further because some
                                of the payouts won't send you to the moon. But if simply having a good time playing is more important than becoming the next multi-millionaire, you should give Karate Pig slots a shot. The thousands of Canadians and others who are already enjoying
                                the adventures, exploits, and generosity of this colourful cartoonish animal character can't all be wrong.</p>
                            <p>Furthermore, you don't have to be a high stakes player with a big bankroll; the game is affordable. You don't have to be a Karate expert either-just keep it to yourself later that luck, not skill, earned you a coveted black belt. But if you are
                                fond of Far Eastern culture and a big Karate fan, and you win a jackpot to boot, this game could put you in hog heaven!</p>

                        <p>Karate Pig was introduced by Microgaming to the online slots world in April, 2012. Its novelty and entertainment value quickly made it an international hit.</p>
                        <p>Karate Pig is a non-progressive jackpot game consisting of 5 reels and 40 paylines. What makes Karate Pig different from many other themed slots is that the reels are filled with such a seemingly completely unrelated hodgepodge of symbols-among
                            them, a sushi bar, jazz musician, fierce warrior, and various objects associated with the Far East like a Buddha and a bonsai tree. Assorted animals also get into the act, including the star of the show, dressed for martial arts, Karate Pig.
                            This is a pig of many talents. He is simultaneously a musician, master sushi chef, and Kung Fu fighting champion.</p>
                        <h2 class="title title--h2">Watch Out for Wild Pigs</h2>
                        <p>The Karate Pig logo is the game's wild symbol. As such, it can substitute for any other symbol, except the scatter symbol, with the capability of turning losing symbols into winning ones. If you succeed in getting five Karate Pig logos on a single
                            spin, one on all five positions of a payline, you will win a jackpot of 2,000 coins.</p>
                        <p>Two gold coin symbols anywhere on both the first and 5th reels give you 15 free spins with your winnings doubled. But, you could wind up with many more free spins, because if, while you are spinning for free, two gold coins show up again, the
                            free spins are retriggered.</p>
                        <p>The Karate Pig Sushi Chef acts as the game's scatter symbol. All you have to do is get 3 or more (position doesn't matter) during a regular spin and you trigger the bonus game. The first 7 times, you pick either the hammer bonus or the pork chop
                            bonus in an attempt to win prizes. If you are successful, you also receive a Karate belt in the colour associated with that particular bonus round, culminating in the coveted black belt, which opens up the final showdown-three intense rounds
                            of battle between Karate Pig and a scary opponent. If Karate Pig emerges victorious, so do you.</p>

                        <p>Fortunately, Karate Pig is a relatively affordable slot game. So you can try for the big money often without making a big dent in your bankroll. You can play for free, or for as little as 1 cent per spin. The machine accepts coins from 1 cent
                            to 10 cents, with a maximum of 50 cents per line. You can also play any number of lines you wish, from 1 to all 40. Thus, your minimum bet per spin is 1 cent, and your maximum bet per spin is 40 x 50 cents, or C$20.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, Karate Pig can be a high variance game. What this means is that big wins tend not to occur that often, and the relatively small payouts you get in the interim may not adequately compensate, especially if you run into some dry
                            spells. But the bright colours, bold graphics, and non-stop hilarity will keep you happily entertained regardless. Besides, the one event you are really waiting for could still happen at any time-the stacked wilds could line up just right, causing
                            all 5 reels to go completely wild at once! The ideal time for that to happen, of course, would be during a free spin, so your winnings would be doubled. That would give you a total of 800,000 coins, the maximum possible payout from Karate Pig.
                            With that kind of windfall, you could be living high off the hog for a long time to come!</p>

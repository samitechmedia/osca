          <h2 class="title title--h2">Fantastic Four Slots Features</h2>
          <p>Fantastic Four slots introduces you to the four main characters right away in the info. In case you forgot, they are Mr. Incredible, The Invisible Woman, The Human Torch and The Thing. They all have their special features to show off, with Mr.
          Incredible being able to make any part of his body lengthen or grow at will. The Invisible Woman is, you guessed it, invisible whenever she wants to be. The Thing is a massive monster made of rock and The Human Torch is a man with a body made
          of flames/ The game itself is fantastic four themed as well, with a blue background and all of the symbols matching their flashy style.</p>
          <p>This slots game offers a huge number of paylines. With 20 ways to win, you have a lot more of a chance than you will see on other online slots. This game makes it easy for you to win a lot of real cash in just a few spins. Not only do you have
        a chance to win one of the four progressive marvel jackpots,&nbsp; there are four stacked wilds that you can spin and win huge prizes and free spins. Each Fantastic four character is a stacked wild, and if you see three of any character line
        up on the reels you will win awesome prizes.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="type-right-side">
          <?php echo getCasinoBlockHTML('fantasticfour', 'game-images'); ?>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>&nbsp;Since this slot has so many paylines, it really pays off to bet the max bet every time. You can bet up to 10 cents per line and up to 20 paylines, giving a max bet of two dollars. This is a lot better than you will see&nbsp; in many slots
        games that have a max bet of five to twenty dollars - that adds up quickly when you sit down and play for a while! This game also has an amazing Scatter bonus. If you see 4 of the scatter symbol, the Fantastic Four's logo which is the number
        4, you will instantly win 10,000 times your line bet. That means up to C$1,000 in one spin!</p>
      <p>&nbsp;The bonus round in Fantastic Four slots is a force to be reckoned with. There are four separate rounds, one for each of the four characters. Mr. Fantastic adds some fantastic expanding wilds to every one of the five reels. The Invisible
      Woman adds increasing multipliers to any win that you stack up on the reels. The Thing also adds sticky wilds, but you can only win up to three extra free spins. If you have any of the Fantastic Four characters on the reels, The Human Torch
      turns them all into Human Torches, and creates a Wild card in the first wheel. You won't find this many bonus features in many other online slots.</p>
      <p>By far the most exciting part of Fantastic Four slots, or any other Marvel slots, are the progressive jackpots. Progressive jackpots mean that each day, as more people play the game, the jackpot amount increases more and more. Every day that you
          play this game, your potential win gets even larger. That is fantastic in itself, but Playtech takes it one (or four!) steps further by granting you access to four individual jackpots. The Power, Super Power, Extra Power, and Ultimate Power
          jackpots are all progressive and all there for the taking!</p>

          <h2 class="title title--h2">Coins and Stakes</h2>
          <p>Some online slots take advantage of players by offering a huge range of betting options, counting on the fact that you will not pay attention to the total bet amount when it is all added up. Fantastic Four slots is more honest and straightforward.
            You can bet between one cent and 10 cents per line, and you have to pay for each line you bet on. This means that if you bet one cent per line and bet on all 20 paylines, your total bet amount for each spin will be 20 cents. You can change this
            amount at any time, and you can also click on the bet max button to quickly bet the maximum amount available. It pays to play the max, because it is not very much at two dollars per spin and your potential payout is so much more when you bet
            more.</p>
          <h2 class="title title--h2">Fantastic Four Slots Symbols</h2>
          <p>The symbols in this Marvel Slots game would be easy to guess. First of all you have the standard &quot;deck of cards&quot; symbols. They are on almost every slot out there, and include the number 10, Jack, Queen, King and Ace. Next you have the Fantastic
          Four number four logo, which is the scatter symbol. There is also an earth symbol. The Fantastic Four themselves each have a symbol on the reels, showing their characters. These character symbols are all wilds and will bring up their individual

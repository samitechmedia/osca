            <p>
              Fei Cui Gong Zhu is another Chinese themed slot game by online slots developer Playtech. This game complements their Chinese New Year slots, Nian Nian You Yu. Unlike Nian Nian You Yu, Fei Cui Gong Zhu comes packed with bonus features and a progressive
              jackpot. This five reels, 20 payline slot features some really amazing graphics, which is what we have come to expect from Playtech. The reels cover the entire screen and are transparent over a lovely water background. It makes you feel peaceful
              and at east just looking at it, as you can see a mountain range off in the distant foggy background. This game has not only one but four progressive jackpots, each connected to a different colour dragon just like in Nian Nian You Yu. Bonus features
              include free spins, secret garden bonus round, dragon progressive jackpot and the gamble feature. </p>
            <p>One of the best features of Playtech slots is that you can play them from anywhere. Playtech does a really nice job of balancing beautiful graphics that are easy to load so that you can play from a tablet or mobile device, not just on casino software
            on your home computer. In a lot of video slots, especially movie themed ones, you will have an actual video play for the intro and the bonus games, This makes it super slow to load and sometimes is not even worth it on a mobile device. With simple
            but pretty graphics, Fei Cui Gong Zhu is fast loading and can be played from a 4G connection or wifi on your smart phone or tablet. That way, you can win the massive progressive dragon jackpot from anywhere!</p>

          <p>Fei Cui Gong Zhu greets you with a beautiful and relaxing intro screen, with a lovely Chines maiden, relaxing Chinese music and some lovely graphics. This game has an overall Chinese theme, with symbols such as a lucky dragon sculpture a red fan,
            a blue and white porcelain vase, a Chinese pagoda and a the Chinese girl from the intro.</p>
          <p>Fei Cui Gong Zhu is an easy slots game to get into and start playing. You will see the reels pop up as soon as you enter the screen - there are five reels running left to right, and 20 paylines. Paylines are ways that you can win if you line up
            symbols along those lines. In classic slots you would only win if you lined up symbols going in a straight line from left to right, but with 20 paylines you have 20 different ways to rack up winning combinations. This really puts the odds in
            your favour, especially in a game with a progressive jackpot like Fei Cui Gong Zhu.</p>
          <h2 class="title title--h2">Fei Cui Gong Zhu Slots Features</h2>
          <p>Fei Cui Gong Zhu is one of those special online slots that you only find once in a while, with the ever elusive progressive jackpot as well as other fun bonus features. Usually you only get one or the other but Playtech took it to a new level
          with v by giving you access to four massive progressive jackpots as well as bonus rounds and huge cash prizes within the game itself. First off you have the free spins feature, which you can trigger at any time by lining up three or more of
          the red temple scatter symbol. These can line up anywhere on the reels and in any of the 20 paylines. During this bonus round, all of your wins are tripled and if you land three more scatter symbols, you will win more free spins.</p>

      <p>One of the most unique features of Fei Cui Gong Zhu is the Gamble feature. If you look at the bottom of your screen you will see the gamble button right next to the spin button. Hit this button and you will be taken to a screen showing two choices
          &quot;red or black&quot; and a card in the middle. You get to double your winnings by choosing red or black, and if you are right you win. You can play this until you lose, then the feature is no longer available. This is unlike anything else we have
          seen on online slots before, and it really shows that this game was well thought out and very original. This feature has a limit of C$1,000 - once you hit that amount, you cannot play any more.</p>
      <p>The secret garden bonus round is another fun feature in Fei Cui Gong Zhu slots. This is a mini game inside of the regular slots game in which you get to pick your prize. You can win this bonus round by lining up at least three or up to five of
        the green temple bonus symbols on the reels. These can be lined up on any active payline. The bonus game takes you to a screen where you will see six beautiful pink flowers and you have the choice of picking either three, four or five of the
        flowers depending on how many bonus symbols you originally lined up. Each flower reveals a real cash prize for you to take back to the bankroll, and they are all added up at the end of your bonus round.</p>
      <p>The dragon progressive jackpot is a real thriller, not only in Fei Cui Gong Zhu&nbsp; slots but in the sister game Nian Nian You Yu, Playtech's Chinese New Year themed slots game. All players that are spinning the reels in either of these two
          games at any point have access to these four dragon jackpots. There are four different colours, each with their own specific value. The value gets reset every time a jackpot is won. The progressive jackpot is triggered randomly, so you could
          really win it at any moment. Once you hit the jackpot trigger, a wheel of fortune game comes up. When you spin the wheel, you collect each colour that it lands on until you collect three of a kind. When this happens, that is the colour of the
          dragon whose jackpot you win. It's as simple as that!</p>

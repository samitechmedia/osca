                            <p>
                                One wonderful thing about today's online slots, especially those from Microgaming, is
                                that they are so varied and imaginative. No one game can be right for everyone's taste,
                                but with hundreds of varieties to choose from, clearly there is something
                                for everyone. On the other hand, even after you find a slot game you love to play, if
                                you overdo it, eventually you will be ready to try something new.
                            </p>
                            <p>If the same old routine seems to be getting you down, and it includes the same old slots,
                                it could be time for a change. The Grand Journey will lead you on an adventure not only
                                as far removed from modern Canadian living as anything you could
                                imagine, but also completely different from any slot game you have ever played. So, if
                                you're feeling adventurous, what are you waiting for? Sign up for The Grand Journey, and
                                don't let those pesky dinosaurs and sabre-tooth tigers intimidate
                                you. If you are lucky, the scary creatures will all go back into extinction, and you
                                will be crowned the new king or queen of the jungle.</p>

                        <p>The Grand Journey is a 5-reel, non-progressive jackpot online slot game with 30 paylines. The
                            game was released by Microgaming for the online market in January, 2012. Its many exciting
                            features have quickly made it a favourite with low to moderate
                            stakes gamblers looking to add a good dose of novelty and adventure to their slot
                            experience.</p>
                        <p>The destination picked for this adventure is an Amazon jungle. Your slot survival skills
                            better be good, though, because, in your quest for hidden treasures, you will also encounter
                            threatening dinosaurs, ferocious saber-tooth tigers, menacing
                            warriors, and erupting volcanoes. But relax, because you will be accompanied by a fearless
                            Jungle Explorer who luckily seems virtually immune to any lurking dangers. That means you're
                            in good hands. So, if you are game, come along for the ride
                            and see what happens. If you can find the jungle's hidden treasures and come away with a big
                            enough stash to fill a treasure chest, even better.
                        </p>
                        <p id="freeGame"><strong>The Grand Journey is no longer available for free play, try
                                Thunderstruck II instead.

                        <h2 class="title title--h2">Lots to See Along the Way</h2>
                        <p>Not all of the Grand Journey symbols are intentionally scary. You will also see mushrooms,
                            stone idols, a temple, the Explorer, the Explorer's travel equipment, and a beautiful Amazon
                            lady. The bold graphics, colorful, lifelike images, and authentic
                            sounds of the jungle will have you riveted to the screen. The symbols become animated during
                            play, so you feel like you really are an active participant in a thrilling adventure.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="type-right-side">
                        <?php echo getCasinoBlockHTML('grandjourney', 'game-images'); ?>
                    </div>
                    <p>On top of all that, The Grand Journey is packed with other exciting features-stacked and
                        expanding wilds, scatter symbols, free spins, multiplied winnings, and a potentially lucrative
                        bonus game. Another nice thing is that despite the game's high
                        volatility, it is still relatively inexpensive. So, even if one expedition is nothing to write
                        home about, you can always return another time, when your luck might be better.</p>
                    <p>You can play The Grand Journey for free, or you can play for real money. But don't let the very
                        limited coin size, 1 cent or 2 cents, fool you into thinking that this is just a penny ante
                        game. There are 30 paylines, so a penny bet won't work;
                        the minimum you can bet per spin, to have all of the paylines working for you, is 30 cents. You
                        also have the option of betting anywhere from 1 to 20 coins on each line. Therefore, the maximum
                        bet per spin is 600 2 cent coins, orC$12. The game
                        does indeed offer enough flexibility in the betting range to suit both low and mid-level
                        players, but probably not high rollers.</p>

                        <h2 class="title title--h2">Wide Variety of Symbols and Bonus Games</h2>
                        <p>The Grand Journey Logo is the game's wild symbol. As such, it can substitute for any other
                            symbol on the reels except the scatter symbol and thereby turn non-winning spins into
                            winners. In addition, whenever the Grand Journey Logo helps to complete
                            a winning combination of other symbols, the payout is doubled.</p>
                        <p>If you get 5 Grand Journey Logos on a single spin, you win the game's largest fixed jackpot
                            of 1,000 coins. However, the wilds are stacked, so with a maximum bet, you could actually
                            win much more. Five of a kind of the various other symbols yield
                            smaller jackpots of 500 coins or less.</p>
                        <p>Most slot machines with stacked wilds have just one wild symbol. After all, what could be
                            more exciting than, on a single spin, to see one symbol singlehandedly turn a whole machine
                            wild! But the Grand Journey didn't stop there. It has added a
                            second wild symbol, a drill, on the middle reel only. This symbol is termed an "expanding
                            wild" because it has the capability of expanding to cover the entire reel.</p>
                        <p>The globe is the game's scatter symbol. While all you need is 2 for a payout, 3 or more on a
                            single spin, anywhere on the reels, triggers 15 free spins. This is also where the game
                            really gets interesting. A detour set up just for you takes you
                            along the jungle's "multiplier trail."</p>
                        <p>During these free spins, instead of a fixed preset multiplier for winning combinations,
                            multipliers increase after you have a losing spin! Ironically, you are actually hoping not
                            to win on consecutive free spins, so that your multipliers can be
                            increased as much as possible.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-12 col-xl-6">
                        <?php include($_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'] . "/includes/jackpot.php"); ?>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>The first time you win on a free spin, the amount is doubled, but after each consecutive losing spin,
                    the win multiplier goes up by 1, all the way to a maximum of 10. Anytime you win a free spin, the
                    multiplier resets back to 2 again. Also, the
                    free spins cannot be retriggered. So you have to be exceptionally lucky to ever reach a really big
                    multiplier, but it is not impossible.</p>
                <p>You will have every right to call yourself King or Queen of the Jungle if you come away from the
                    Grand Journey with the maximum win of 6,000,000 coins. The way to do it is have the whole machine go
                    wild on a free spin with a 10x multiplier.</p>
                <p>In any case, this game offers a thrilling, but sometimes bumpy ride. Watch out for the inevitable
                    bankroll swings as you try to scoop up as much hidden treasure as you can.</p>

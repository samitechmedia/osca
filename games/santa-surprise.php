        <p>
        Santa Surprise online slots is one of the most fun and wholesome Christmas themed slots out there. Playtech is known for having a lot of paylines on their slots, and this game is no exception. Santa Slots has 20 paylines, which means that every
          time you spin the reels, you have 20 different possibilities for winning combinations. All you need to do is line up 3 or more of one of the Christmas symbols on any of these 20 paylines and you will win real money. The more symbols you line
          up, the more you earn. Each symbol has it's own amount that it pays out depending on how many you are able to line up. The maximum payout is 10,000 coins, which can earn you C$20,000 if you are betting the maximum amount.
        </p>
        <h2 class="title title--h2">Santa Surprise Slots Features</h2>
        <p>
        Santa Surprise totally immerses you in the Christmas theme, right up from the introduction. As the game loads, you see an image of the big man himself, riding on his sleigh led by his 12 faithful reindeer. Jingle Bells plays in the background
          as Santa flies high over a snowy, sleepy town below. When you get to the game itself, the Christmas theme just keeps on giving. The symbols are all Christmas themed, with trees, wreaths, candles, stockings, bells and Santa hats. Even the card
          symbols are Christmas themed, with fun stripes and candy canes.
        </p>
        <p>
            Santa Surprise really embodies the Christmas spirit by offering so many bonus features to players. On my very first spin, I won the bonus round. The bonus symbol is the Christmas tree itself – it says “BONUS” right on it. When you spin three trees
          or more it takes you to the living room where the Christmas tree is decorated for the season and Christmas decorations hang all around. The feeling is warm and cheery as Santa introduces the bonus round to you in his jolly voice. Six presents
          appear on the screen, looking beautiful in their holiday wrapping and ribbons and bows. All you need to do is click on a present to reveal the cash prize hidden within. You get to pick three prizes total and your winnings are added up at the
          end of the round. In my three boxes I won a total ofC$148. Not bad for a single spin!
        </p>

    <p>
      This game also features scatter symbols and wilds. The big man himself, Santa is the wild symbol. He will appear on the reels multiple times while you are spinning, and he substitutes for any other symbol. This is why it pays to play the max bet
      for every spin – If you spin a Santa Claus and he can match up with a few different options, he will always go with the highest payout possible. If you are not playing on that payline, however, you won't be able to win the prize. If you always
      bet on every payline, you guarantee that you will not miss out on an opportunity to use the Santa wild symbol.
    </p>
    <p>
        One of the coolest features of this holiday game is the number of paylines it offers. With a lot of other casino companies out there, you will see as little as 10 or even 5 paylines. Not with Playtech, though. Playtech is known for offering a
      ton of ways to win to their players, and Santa Surprise is right up there with their other slots. Santa Surprise offers 20 paylines every time you spin. With each spin, you have the opportunity to line up symbols going left to right on 20 different
      combinations. This is huge! The only downside is that you have to bet on every payline individually. This can get expensive, but the potential payout is much more if you do bet the max.
    </p>
    <p>When you consider the 10,000 coin jackpot, you will really want to bet the max. If you win the jackpot playing the minimum 10 cent bet, you will win only C$1,000. That is not bad, but if you consider the fact that you could win C$20,000 by betting
      the 2 dollar maximum, you will definitely want to increase your chances of winning big.</p>
    <p>Multipliers are also included in the Santa Surprise online slots game. If you spin 3 or more of the symbol featuring a snowy outdoor scene, you win 10 free spins with a 3x multiplier on any wins! You can even win additional free spins during your
      10 spins. This is one of those times when the payouts can increase exponentially and just keep on going! The Scatter symbol is the symbol that features Santa's workshop. Scatters pay out 2x, 5x, 50x or 5000x for 2, 3, 4 or 5 symbols respectively.
      Can you imagine hitting the jackpot on a 5000x scatter round? The only exception to the rule is the Christmas Tree Bonus Round. Those winnings are not multiplied by the Scatter symbol.</p>

        <h2 class="title title--h2">Coins and Stakes</h2>
        <p>Santa Surprise slots features a wide variety of coin values – one cent, five cents, 10 cents, 25 cents, one dollar and two dollars. You first need to select the amount of money you want for your line bet. This means you can bet between one and
        10 coins for each payline you want to play. If you are playing all 20 paylines, your line bet will be multiplied by 20 to come up with your total bet. You can also adjust the coin value to any of the dollar amounts listed above. The maximum
        possible bet if you are betting the max coin value, bet per line and number of paylines is C$40 per spin. The minimum is 10 cents if you are spinning on just one payline and betting one coin at the minimum value.</p>
        <h2 class="title title--h2">Santa Surprise Slots Symbols</h2>
        <p>In the online slots game “Santa's Surprise” you will not be surprised to find out that all of the symbols are themed around a white snowy Christmas. You will first notice the normal “deck of cards” symbols of 10, Jack, Queen, King and Ace. These
        are Christmas themed too – the 10 has candles and ribbons wrapped around them, the Jack has a candy orange candy cane and a bow, the Queen has a wreath and a bow, the King has a Christmas scarf wrapped around it and the Ace is wearing a Santa hat.</p>
        <p>
        The other symbols are also rich in holiday spirit. You have a Christmas present in red and green wrapping, a set of golden bells with red ribbon, Santa himself looking as jolly as ever, Santa's workshop with a snowy outdoor scene, the Christmas
        Tree Bonus symbol,&nbsp; and a green and red Christmas stocking.

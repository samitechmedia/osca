          <h2 class="title title--h2">Bonus Bears Online Slots Features</h2>
          <p>
            Bonus Bears has a simplistic quality that is missing from a lot of modern online slots. It has simple, quick loading graphics and an easy story line that anyone can follow. Unlike some of the fancier video slots with 3D graphics, long intros and
            multiple super involved bonus games, Bonus Bears takes only seconds to load. This is great especially if you are playing from a phone mobile device or tablet. Bonus Bears will not slow you down, you can play from anywhere and win tons of cash
            instantly.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Wild symbol in Bonus Bears is the big bear himself. He appears with a cheeky grin on his face to bring you real cash prizes and free spins. The bear icon appears on reels two, three and four and can substitute for any of the other symbols
            in the game, on any payline so that you will always get the maximum payout combination. If you catch three wild bears on your reels at once, even if they are not in a line, you automatically win 15 free spins. When you win, he even does a nice
            little dance for you.

            As we all know, bears love their honey. This bear is no different, as he keeps his very own honey bees. The beehive is the scatter symbol in Bonus Bears, and when you spin three or more beehives, you activate the Honey Feature. The more hives
            you spin on the reels, the higher your winnings will be when you line up three or more of the same symbol on one of the 25 paylines. If you are lucky enough to line up five scatter symbols or more, just wait because you are in for a treat! Bees
            will swarm on to the screen and award you a prize ofC$125,000! With just one spin, you can win that much cash.
          </p>
          <p>
            The bonus game in Bonus Bears is easy to trigger. Just line up a bear on the 2
            <sup>nd</sup>, 3
            <sup>rd</sup> and 4
            <sup>th</sup> reels at the same time. This automatically awards you another 15 free spins, and during those spins your winnings are increased by three-fold! You can even re-trigger even more free spins while playing out your original 15 bonus spins.
          </p>
          <p>
            When you activate the Honey feature, five frees will appear, each with a honey pot resting on a branch. Just point the bear in the direction of the tree you want to pick and he will climb it and reveal your prize to you. Prizes can range from
            free spins to cold hard cash. When you see the beehive you will be awarded with a prize that is worth two times your current bet, so make sure to met the maximum so that when you win a bonus round you can cash out big. Honey equals money in
            Bonus Bears, so try to access this bonus round as often as you can!
          </p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;The real sweet deal in Bonus Bears, however, is the jackpot. This awesome game goes above and beyond by awarding you a maximum real cash prize of 5,000 coins. This is not quite as much as some games, but when you consider the fact that yo
          have 25 paylines to choose from and any of these could trigger the jackpot, you can see how this is a really awesome feature. Not only that, you can even trigger a jackpot win during any one of your free spins in the bonus round. The jackpot
          is a fixed coin amount, not a fixed dollar amount, so keep in mind that the more you bet, the more you will win!

      <h2 class="title title--h2">Coins and Stakes</h2>
      <p>
        The coin range in this wild woodland adventure runs from as little as two cents, to as much as ten dollars. You can choose your bet amount by clicking on the “bet per line,” “bet max” and plus and minus buttons on the screen. You must select a
        coin value, which is the amount every coin is worth in your bet, as well as the number of coins you want to bet. Multiply these two by the number of lines you want to play and you will have the dollar amount for your final bet. Or, you can just
        select max bet and go all the way! This is a sure way to make sure that you win the maximum if you happen to spin a bonus feature or jackpot.
      </p>
      <h2 class="title title--h2">Bonus Bears Slots Symbols</h2>
      <p>
        The symbols in the Bonus Bears online slots game are all related to the familiar national park scene. Picnic baskets, bears, park rangers, honey bees and their hives, and wild animals such as birds and skunks abound. You will also find the familiar
        “deck of cards” symbols, such as the numbers one through 10, as well as the face card symbols – Jack, Queen, King and Ace. These are not worth quite as much as the wildlife themed symbols but they will still earn you cash prizes if you line
        up three or more on any of the 25 paylines in this game. Remember, the bear himself is the wild card in this game. Line up 3 or more and you win! The more symbols you line up, the bigger your prize will be.

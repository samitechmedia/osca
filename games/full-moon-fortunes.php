          <p>Full Moon Fortunes is a fun horror themed slots game that takes place in 1860's England. In the game intro, Dr. Blackwood is attacked by a vicious beast. He survives, but at a terrible cost. He is turned into the same beast that viciously attacked
            him, a werewolf. This game has features such as the graveyard bonus game, free spins, Full Moon multiplier wilds, and regular wilds. You won't often find so many bonus features in a slot machine with 20 paylines, so definitely take advantage!
            There is a 12,500 coin jackpot at stake when you are in the free spins feature, and a 500 coin jackpot in the regular game. With prizes like that, it always pays to bet the max on each and every spin. Read on to learn more about this horrifyingly
            fun slots game.</p>
          <h2 class="title title--h2">Full Moon Fortunes Slots Features</h2>
          <p>Full Moon Fortunes slots is a high variance slot machine. Most 20 paylines slots are low variance, meaning you do not have to bet much per spin but you also do not have any chance at a huge cash prize. The prizes in low variance games are usually
            smaller and more frequent. In high variance slots such as Full Moon Fortunes, with every spin you have the chance to win a huge sized winning combination or a bonus feature with massive prizes. At any moment, you can trigger gigantic wins, making
            this game all the more exciting and not just because of the werewolf!</p>
          <p>The excitement starts right from the beginning, when you are informed in the intro that Dr. Blackwood is a wild multiplier and can multiply your wins up to 25x! The Full Moon symbol is also a huge deal in this game. If you get the Dr. Blackwood
          symbols on any of the reels, as well as the Full Moon symbol on the 5
          <sup>th</sup> reel, those Dr. Blackwoods are turned into Wilds. This means that they substitute for any other symbols and pay the maximum possible combination. You can really increase your winnings with Wilds, giving you line ups that otherwise would
          not be possible.</p>

      <p>Playtech takes things to the next level with their Night of the Full Moon Free Spins feature. First, you need to spin three or more Scatter symbols anywhere on the reels. This awards you with your first set of free spins. If you hit three Tombstone
          Scatter symbols, you will get a free spin with 1x multipliers. If you get four Tombstone Scatter symbols lined up on the reels, you will get two free spins with 2x multipliers. If you are lucky enough to spin five tombstones, you will get three
        free spins with 3x multipliers.</p>
      <p>After your three free spins with 3x multipliers are up, as if that was not enough, you then get access to a bonus game. The bonus game takes you to a new screen that features a graveyard full of spooky gravestones. Your job is to pick gravestones
        out of the bunch in order to win more free spins and multipliers. If you run into a collect symbol, your bonus game ends instantly. If you are able to avoid this symbol for long enough, you can win enough free spins and multipliers to reach
        the maximum of 20 free spins and 25x multipliers. This could award you a jackpot maximum of 12,500 coins, which if you are playing the max bet comes out toC$125,000! That is a prize worth playing for!</p>
      <p>Even in the regular game, you have the chance for massive multiplied wins. If you see the full moon symbol on the 5
          <sup>th</sup> reel, it means that Dr. Blackwood is wild. He will substitute for any other symbol, and depending on how many Dr. Blackwoods you have on the screen, he will multiply your wins up to 5x. As you can see, high variance slots games like
          Full Moon Fortunes give you plenty of chances to win huge prizes, whether you play high stakes or low.</p>

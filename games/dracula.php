          <h2 class="title title--h2">A Slot To Sink Your Teeth Into</h2>
          <p>Canadian slot fans who love classic horror will be chomping at the bit to sink their teeth into this Dracula inspired gambling game. With a plot that closely mirrors the 1931 film, which was of course based on Bram Stokers' original novel
            of the same name. This NetEnt and Universal Studios collaboration is a shining example of what can be achieved when top entertainment and online gambling collide. With 5 reels and 40 paylines, Dracula's spooky style gameplay might just make
            you jump out of your seat, but the chance to win real and lucrative Canadian dollars should silence any fears you have about giving this online slot a go. Even if you're not a natural horror fan, the graphics and storyline have enough to
            offer from an entertainment point of view to make it worthwhile, and of course the chance to win real money is always a great incentive to play.</p>
          <h2 class="title title--h2">Will You Awaken The Beast?</h2>
          <p>This is the third time that NetEnt have teamed up with Universal to deliver online slots gambling and like its predecessors, the Dracula online slots do not disappoint. As you might expect from a developer that has launched some of the best
            looking online casino games available in Canada, Dracula opens with a video animation to set the scene for what's to come in the game.</p>
          <p>Once you've watched him stalk and successfully prey on his latest victim, you progress to being able to interact with the game at hand. As we mentioned, the Dracula game has 5 reels and 40 paylines, 20 of which must be played at any one time.
            Wagers can be set from a coin value of 0.01 to 1.00 respectively, and you also select a bet level, which in Dracula ranges from 1-10.</p>
          <p>The symbols used on the reel take the form of playing card suits, along with 'lost souls'. In our Dracula online review we found that he is pretty vocal about how he feels when you strike a win, with a snarl from him being a typical outcome
              to this occurring. If not expecting it, this reaction is enough to make you jump the first few times it happens.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="type-right-side">
          <?php echo getCasinoBlockHTML('dracula', 'game-images'); ?>

      </div>
      <div class="row type-section-padding-bottom">
        <div class="col-12 col-xl-6">
          <p>There are some interesting features that make gameplay all the more exciting. For example, a randomly generated bat feature, that sees a fleet of bats surround the reels and alter the symbols. This happens quite often throughout gameplay,
          and can result in some good real cash wins, if the symbols matched offer the higher returns.</p>
          <p>The other thing to take note of is the W symbol that appears on reels 2,3 and 4, and subs for all the other symbols on those reels. The good thing about the W symbol is that whenever it happens, you always get the most lucrative combination
            so it's a great bonus feature of the game.</p>
          <h2 class="title title--h2">Take Flight With Dracula Mobile</h2>
          <p>The great news for iPhone, Android, and other app based smartphone users in Canada, is that Dracula online slots is optimized for mobile gaming. So no matter what smartphone or mobile device you use, you'll be able to access all of Dracula's
            great features on the go, wherever you decide to log on and play.</p>
          <p>During our Dracula review we checked out the game on many popular mobile platforms, and can highly recommend trying out this version. You'll love the ease that comes from playing on the go.</p>
          <h2 class="title title--h2">Dracula Reviewed - What We Thought</h2>
          <p>
            This is the best vampire based online slot we've come across in our opinion, and we don't say that lightly, as we test and review every new slot game coming onto the market. Not only is Dracula fun to play, it looks incredible and the payouts
            are frequent and forthcoming so it's quick and easy to build up your bank roll. What's great is that the mobile version of this online slot is also as impressive to play as on a bigger screen. It's brilliant for both desktop and smartphone
            users in Canada looking for a fun and interactive online slot game, it's also incredibly reliable &amp; secure.

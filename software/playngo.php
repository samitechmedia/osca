        <h2 class="title title--h2">Company History</h2>
        <p>
          Play'n GO was founded by a group of professionals with extensive experience in online gaming. In 1997, they developed a gaming solution while acting as a sub-contractor to another gaming company. They would later break off into their own independent company, one that has proven to be competitive in both the public and private sectors.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since 2004, Play'n Go has also been a leader in the world of mobile gambling. Since developing a working pilot in that year, Play'n GO has developed mobile gaming solutions that work with all mobile platforms, including Apple, Android, Windows and Blackberry products.
        </p>
        <h2 class="title title--h2">Software</h2>
        <p>
          Play'n GO offers a high-qualify software program that offers all of their games in an instant play format in 30 languages. Each game supports full high-definition graphics and can be tailored to the needs and fashions of local markets.
        </p>
        <p>
          One unique feature found through the Play'n GO software is the availability of widget ggames. These miniature versions of games can be integrated directly into a casino's website or in banner ads and emails, allowing them to be used as a promotional tool.
        </p>
        <p>
          Along with their internet-based casino and bingo offerings, Play'n GO has also developed mobile gaming solutions for smartphones and tablets. At the time of this writing, their mobile platform features at least 33 games, each of which can be played in any of 30 supported languages.
        </p>
        <h2 class="title title--h2">Games and Features</h2>
        <p>
          There are more than 50 games in the Play'n GO casino lineup, with more being released on a regular basis.
        </p>
        <h2  class="title title--h2">Casino Games </h2>
        <p>
          When it comes to table games, Play'n GO offers a wide range of the most popular games, including baccarat, Pai Gow Poker, and their own version of Caribbean Stud Poker (known as Casino Stud Poker). However, their real focus is on blackjack, where they offer eight different versions of the game, including several that allow players to play multiple hands. There are also three versions of roulette, including a rarely seen French roulette game. Their software also includes several popular video poker machines and a scratch card game.

      Sheriff Gaming is based in Eindhoven in the Netherlands. Founded in 2010, this privately-owned company specializes in interactive, animated 3D slots and table games. Sheriff Gaming may be young but that doesn’t equate to a small portfolio; they
      display an impressive roll-out schedule with a goal of a new game every month. They have already established a portfolio of over 60 casino games in 21 different languages.

    <h2 class="title title--h2">Company History</h2>
    <p>
      Sheriff Gaming joined a very competitive gaming market with a specific goal of becoming a cutting-edge expert in the arena of animated 3D casino games. They have been rolling out new games at a lightning fast pace and entering into strategic agreements
      to promote those games just as aggressively.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early 2012 brought a deal with NYX Interactive to launch all Sheriff Gaming 3D games via the NYX Open Gaming System (NYX OGS). Later that year, Sheriff Gaming reached an agreement to integrate several of their interactive games into Microgaming’s QuickFire platform. 2013 started just as assertively, with both a deal for Sheriff Gaming to develop three online games for the gaming manufacturer and distributor, Eurocoin Interactive, and another agreement to integrate their portfolio into Edict eGaming’s suite of casino games.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 2013 Sheriff Gaming announced a deal that integrates its entire suit of 3D games into SkillOnNet's gaming platform and onto online casinos such as EUcasino, PlayMillion Casino, and Vegas Winner. This was quickly followed by an announcement in June 2013 that Panda Media had Sheriff Gaming to supply 3D slot games, table games, keno and scratch cards to Videoslots.com and Emucasino.com.
    </p>
    <h2 class="title title--h2">Software</h2>

      Sheriff Gaming has a new mobile gambling platform for both Android and iOS platforms. Called Mobile Smart™, this product offers existing slot titles such as The Amsterdam Masterplan™ SMART and Spartania™ SMART, and also new games including The Robets™ SMART and Alawin™ SMART.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sheriff Gaming is currently working on new technology to make their portfolio of games available on 3D televisions and computer screens using technology that doesn’t require special glasses.
    </p>
    <h2 class="title title--h2">Games and Features</h2>
    <p>
      Sheriff Gaming offers twenty video slots, half a dozen progressive slots, more than 10 table games, two Kenos, and four scratch cards.

    </p>

    <p>
      Sheriff Gaming has its own progressive jackpot network called the Mega Money Pool, connected to many of their slot games and offered with one of their blackjack variants and with their Caribbean poker game.
    </p>
    <h3 class="title title--h4">Slot Games</h3>
    <p>

      Good examples of the interactive nature of Sheriff Gaming slots can be found in The Amsterdam Master Plan where players are asked to assist in planning a daring casino robbery and in Dr. Magoo's Adventure, where players can help look for a mysterious
      treasure.

        <h2 class="title title--h2">Company History</h2>
        <p>
          Genesis Gaming Inc. has established a reputation for developing video slot games that focus on high-quality art, creative and humorous bonus features, and outstanding music. Their portfolio of over 75 slot games are known for smooth running interfaces and include interactive bonus rounds, 243 ways to win, and the features players expect such as wilds and scatters.
        </p>
        <p>
          They partner actively with other gaming companies, providing exclusive content for the Microgaming-powered Quickfire platform and for International Game Technology (IGT). Genesis Gaming Inc. video slot games such as Area 21 and Just Vegas are also distributed under the Cryptologic brand.
        </p>
        <h2 class="title title--h2">Games and Features</h2>
        <p>
          In March, 2013, Genesis Gaming, Inc. announced the first game released for the Quickfire platform, Arabian Caravan. This game, inspired by the merchants and bazaars of ancient Arabia, was quickly followed only a few weeks later by three more games for that platform: Royal Roller, Journey of the Sun, and Disco Night Fright. That same month Genesis Gaming Inc. announced the launch of an exclusive game, Sugar Doggie, for the 888.com online casino. They have also released Cannonball Bay for Betclic.com and Expekt.com.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second quarter of 2013 brought the rapid-fire release of several more games, including Yggdrasil, Taboo Spell, Gothic, and Path of the Wizard. They are not showing any signs of slowing down; releasing two more games in July 2013: Orc's Battle and Maritime Maidens.
        </p>
        <p>
          Genesis Gaming Inc. <a href="/games/video-slots" class="text--link">video slot games</a> include titles that highlight the company's tongue-in-cheek style of humour. One popular example is Hells Grannies: Knit Happens, where little old ladies with mohawks and tattoos ride through the game in a very unexpected motorcycle gang. In another game, Sugar Doggies, the game takes a comical look at dogs living the good life. Zombie lovers will find humour when playing Alaxe in Zombieland, where only Alaxe retains the sweet nature of the Alice in Wonderland characters we know from childhood;
          everyone else is a zombie!

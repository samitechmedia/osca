    <p>
      Aristocrat, Australia's best-known gambling software and hardware developer, actually started way back in 1953. They have now grown from offline systems to online ones and are currently active in North American, Australian, and Asian markets, developing web-based and mobile systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      They made that move in early 2011, branching into software design and online services after partnering with NextGen Gaming. There are now over a dozen Aristocrat online slot games available, all accessed through Aristocrat's partnerships with online casinos or directly through Aristocrat's remote server. Of course, you can enjoy their games in both play money and real money modes.

        <h2 class="title title--h2">Company History</h2>
        <p>
          In March, 2011 Aristocrat entered the world of online slots gaming with the release of several games at Bet365. Their first titles available were Zorro, Queen of the Nile 2, Lucky 88 and Where's The Gold.
        </p>
        <p>
          In May 2013 Aristocrat signed a deal to integrate the Amaya-owned Ongame poker software into its online gaming platform and received an online poker licence in Nevada. This positions Aristocrat to offer Ongame poker for play money, with a real-money version to be provided where US regulation permits. Aristocrat's European presence was expanded with a deal with NYX Gaming Group and the acquisition of social casino operator Product Madness.
        </p>
        <h2 class="title title--h2">Software</h2>
        <p>
          The full range of Aristocrat online slot games can be seen and accessed either online or through their remote server. Aristocrat also provides its customers with special apps for <a href="/iphone">iPhones</a> and iPads so that they can operate with play money. One great addition to their slot games is the excellent feature that provides players with the opportunity to replicate the experience of big jackpot wins. In addition to this great feature, they also have an interactive side with leader boards and achievements adding to your overall online slot experience.
        </p>
        <h2 class="title title--h2">Games and Features</h2>
        <h3 class="title title--h4">Slot Games</h3>
        <p>
          Slots game titles that are available for mobile casino players include 5 Dragons, Dragon Emperor, Geisha, Imperial House, Sun and Moon and Wicked Winnings II.
        </p>
        <p>
          Aristocrat's online video slots offer between 3 and 50 paylines, and many of their games have repeat win options and other standard features of online slots such as scatter symbols, wild symbols, and bonus rounds. Examples of <a href="https://www.aristocrat.com/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" class="text--link">Aristocrat</a> special features include Reel Power that allows players to purchase reels instead of lines and Drag 'n Drop Wild where players can move the Drag 'n Drop Wild symbol onto any symbol position on the reels. Some Aristocrat slots let players place an extra bet for the chance of winning additional free spins or offer "sticky" wilds that stay on the reel over a number of spins to generate additional opportunities to win.

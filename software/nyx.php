      NYX Interactive is an online gaming software company that is based in Stockholm, Sweden. Founded in 2006 by a group of ten gaming experts, NYX Interactive specializes in the development of gaming solutions for a number of large gaming companies around the world. They offer bingo, lottery and casino platforms that give their clients access to a wide range of games and products.

    <h2 class="title title--h2">Company History</h2>
    <p>
      Since their founding in 2006, NYX Interactive – a part of the NYX Gaming Group – has marketed their products around the world. However, they've had a particularly strong presence in their home nation of Sweden, where state-licensed Svenska Spel has used their software to power their games. They've also been honored in Sweden and Europe, winning awards for their innovations and being noted as one of the fastest growing companies in the region.
    </p>
    <p>
      A major step for the company came in 2012, when NYX Interactive launched the NYX Open Gaming System (or NYX OGS). This new gaming platform provided clients with over 75 games, including both NYX's own game library and additional games from Sheriff Gaming. In theory, the system would also allow games from other software providers to be offered on the same platform as well.

        <h2 class="title title--h2">Software</h2>
        <p>
          NYX Interactive offers a variety of different platforms and products for online gambling sites. However, their main goal is flexibility: providing platforms that are open to integration with many different breeds of gaming products.
        </p>
        <p>
          This began with the Rapid Platform, which was designed to allow operators to get sites up and running in various jurisdictions without locking them into proprietary systems that could potentially be inflexible. That idea was taken to a new level when the company launched NYX OGS, a system that made it simple to integrate games from not only NYX and Sheriff Gaming, but also many third party game providers, providing hundreds of games in an instant play, no download format.
        </p>
        <p>
          NYX also has a mobile platform known as MOVE, which can work on both smartphones and tablets with most of the same functionality as the PC versions of their games. NYX also offers a dedicated bingo client, lottery games for state lotteries, and fixed-odds games that can be themed for different jurisdictions and companies.
        </p>
        <h2 class="title title--h2">Games and Features</h2>
        <p>
          NYX offers hundreds of different games through their various platforms (many of which are third party games), with availability differing based on the client and jurisdiction each site is based in.
        </p>
        <h2 class="title title--h2">Slots</h2>
        <p>
          Along with many third party games, NYX has developed more than 20 slot machines. Most of these games are five-reel games, none of which feature progressive jackpots. Popular titles include Tiki Treasure and Funland Festival.

    <h2 class="title title--h2">Casino Games</h2>
    <p>
      NYX features a variety of other games in their casino software, including a selection of table games and video poker. They are particularly well-known for their scratch card games, which offer a variety of different gameplay options rather than simply being skins over the same basic scratch-off game.
    </p>
    <h2 class="title title--h2">Casinos</h2>
    <p>
      NYX Interactive has licensed their software out to dozens of online casinos and gambling sites, including state-operated sites in Sweden and France. They also provide software to many privately-owned sites, including:

      </ul>
    </p>
    <h2 class="title title--h2">Responsible Gaming</h2>
    <p>Given NYX's prominent place in many government-operated gaming sites, it should come as no surprise that they hold a variety of certifications and licensing approvals around the world. NYX's software has been approved by the Isle of Man Gaming Supervisory Commission, the Maltese Lottery and Gaming Authority, the World Lottery Association, and the lottery agencies of both Sweden and France. </p>

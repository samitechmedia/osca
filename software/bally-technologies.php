      Today, based in Las Vegas, Bally Technologies offers a wide range of services including mobile applications like the Bally slots app, iGaming platforms, and casino-management systems.

          Bally Technologies has expanded into non-US markets, with a European sales and service hub in Amsterdam. They signed a deal with casino supplier iSoftBet to supply video lottery games in Europe and are doing the same with the Atlantic Lottery Corporation
          to provide video lottery games in several provinces of Canada (Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, Newfoundland and Labrador). In June 2013 Bally Technologies signed a deal with Optimal Payments to offer customers services including credit card,
          debit card and electronic cheque processing and risk management.

    <p>
      With a solid reputation for slot game machines popular at brick and mortar casino, Bally Technologies has released real money online games featuring some of their most popular machine slots. The list includes Big Vegas, Cupid &amp; Psyche, Cash
      Wave, Mayan Treasures, Wild Huskies, Morocco, and Pharaoh's Dream.
    </p>
    <h2 class="title title--h2">Casinos</h2>
    <p>
      Bally Technologies online slot games are available at Mecca Bingo, Paddy Power and Mr. Green. Bally is perhaps better known amongst offline casinos, where it has been involved in supplying items to the industry since the 1930s. Of course, with the
      rise in online gaming, Bally Technologies has refocused considerably and is now gaining more and more market share amongst online casino operators.

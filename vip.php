              How Do The VIP Levels Work?

                    <div class="accordion__content">
                        <p>
                            Every online slot casino has its own system but, basically, you can expect five to seven VIP
                            levels. The first one, usually called Bronze, is where you start. If you don't play for real
                            money, or at least not for much, this is where you'll find yourself. </p>
                        <p>
                            From there, the levels increase until you reach the Platinum level or the Priv&ecoute;
                            level. The higher you go, the better. Playing at a high level means that you can earn VIP
                            points more quickly and that you get access to special features like concierge service or
                            customized prizes. </p>

              How Do I Increase My VIP Status?
              <i class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden="true"></i>
            </span>
                    <div class="accordion__content">
                        <p>
                            There is only one way to increase your VIP status at casinos with online slots: playing with
                            real money. Your level is determined by VIP loyalty points, which are directly generated by
                            the bets you make. The more bets you make, the more VIP loyalty points you earn. </p>
                        <p>
                            The good news is that the same number of points is generated whether you win or lose. Even
                            better, slot players get 100% VIP point conversion while players of some other games might
                            not be as lucky. If you're interested in playing table games like blackjack, you need to be
                            aware that those games might only throw off a fraction of the VIP points. </p>

              What Benefits Can You Get by Participating in a Casino's VIP Program?
              <i class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden="true"></i>
            </span>
                    <div class="accordion__content">
                        <p>
                            VIP programs come in all shapes and sizes so we have to generalize a bit here. </p>
                        <p>
                            However, there is one thing basically all VIP programs have in common: cash back
                            rewards. </p>
                        <p>
                            Just like how your credit card company may offer bonus cash back with every purchase you
                            make on your credit card, it's common to receive about 1% of your bets in the form of
                            cash-back bonuses. </p>
                        <p>
                            Once you get past this standard reward, though, anything is possible. If your VIP status is
                            high enough, you can even expect things like all-expense paid vacations (especially to
                            gambling events) and birthday surprises. </p>

              How Much Does it Usually Cost to Enroll into a VIP Program?
              <i class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden="true"></i>

                    <div class="accordion__content">
                        <p>
                            Typically, VIP programs at the top online casinos for slot players (like the ones listed
                            here) don't charge you anything to take part in their VIP programs. Some may require you to
                            sign up, but the majority of online casinos will simply auto-enroll you into their VIP
                            program the day you become a member. </p>
                        <p>
                            That being said, you still have to remember that real money gambling is still a requirement
                            to actually enjoy the benefits of the program. The big redeeming factor of this, though, is
                            that even wildly successful players get just as many points as everyone else. Winning or
                            losing won't slow you down at all. </p>

            <h2 class="title title--h2">What Is Problem Gambling?</h2>

            <img class="artright" src="/images/gambling-problem.png" alt="Slot tips" width="352" height="250">
            <p>Problem gambling is the extreme end of a sliding scale that the Canadian Problem Gambling Index
                categorizes as follows: </p>
            <ul class="bullet__list bullet__list--check-green type-margin-bottom">
                <li class="bullet__item">Non-gambling</li>
                <li class="bullet__item">Non-problem gambling</li>
                <li class="bullet__item">Low risk gambling</li>
                <li class="bullet__item">Moderate risk gambling</li>
                <li class="bullet__item">Problem gambling</li>
            </ul>


            <p>Problem gambling occurs when an individual has lost control of their gambling. They exhibit behaviours
                that are detrimental to their health and well being, and their problems may extend to affect the well
                being of friends and family. The affected person will routinely bet more than they can afford, and will
                display negative behaviour traits such as increased recklessness, lying to friends and family and
                becoming aggressive when confronted about their gambling activities. Problem gambling has been recently
                reassigned as an addiction in the DSM (The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders). This
                has led to a greater understanding of the problem and the way it can be treated. Affected individuals
                suffer a complex problem that needs to be treated with care and professional help. </p>


            <p>Being on a winning streak does not mean that a person should bet more than they can afford. The tables
                can turn harshly and without warning, and a gambler should always remain in control of their spending.
                When this gets out of hand, it is likely that the gambler has fallen into the trap of addiction. Often
                problem gamblers do not know when to walk away from the table, and will keep betting, compulsively, and
                without regard to their increasing debt. </p>

            <h2 class="title title--h2">Why Does Gambling Get Out Of Control?</h2>
            <img class="lazy artright" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 297 178'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-src="/images/bad-slots.png" alt="Hooked on Gambling" width="297" height="178">

            <p>A problem gambler will often be incredibly secretive about their addiction. They will attempt to maintain
                the semblance of normalcy, even while their life is spiraling out of control. They do this to protect
                their addiction, as it has over taken their brain to become the most important thing in their lives.
                This happens because of a problem with the reward center in the brain. Gambling stimulates the reward
                center in the brain to produce a pleasurable feeling. Dopamine and serotonin are released, producing a
                similar experience to certain drugs. This is where the addiction comes into play. When these reward
                centers are over stimulated, the brain can become dependent on the sensation and feels a sense of loss
                when they are not aroused. This causes the individual to disregard other aspects of their personal life,
                such as family and fiscal welfare, in order to placate the gambling addiction. </p>


            <h2 class="title title--h2">How Can I Spot A Problem Gambler? </h2>

            <p>The symptoms that a problem gambler exhibits are similar to other addictions. These include but are not
                limited to: </p>
            <ul class="bullet__list bullet__list--check-green type-margin-bottom">
                <li class="bullet__item">
                    Secrecy and defensiveness around finances and free
                    time
                </li>
                <li class="bullet__item">
                    Surprising outbursts of aggression
                </li>
                <li class="bullet__item">
                    Asking to borrow money or having money go missing
                </li>
                <li class="bullet__item">
                    Depression and anxiety
                </li>
                <li class="bullet__item">
                    Suicidal tendencies
                </li>
            </ul>


            <p>While these are the warning signs to watch out for, they are only the symptoms and not the cause of the
                afflicted persons addiction. There are many reasons why someone can turn to gambling as a temporary
                solution to their problems. It is this root cause that professional therapy will help the victim to
                overcome.</p>

            <h2 class="title title--h2">How To Combat Problem Gambling </h2>
            <img class="lazy artright" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 1 1'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-src="/images/gethelp.png" alt="Get Help For Gambling Problems" width="275" height="275">
            <p>If you or a member of your family is suffering from this disease then it is vital that you obtain
                professional help as soon as possible. The best place to start is at
                <a href="http://www.gamblersanonymous.org/ga/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gambling Anonymous</a>, but a full list of resources will
                be available at the end of this article. Gamblers Anonymous, like it's more famous alcoholic
                counterpart, is a 12-step program that focuses on group support and therapy. Choosing a sponsor is a
                vital part of the healing process. A sponsor is another member of Gamblers Anonymous who the individual
                can turn to when temptation arises. Both ex-gamblers can encourage each other to remain strong with the
                added benefit of experience and understanding. </p>

            <p>If a family member is affected, approach them kindly and helpfully, and try not to be drawn into an
                argument. Arguing with an addict is a futile effort, as the problem gambler will use negativity to fuel
                their desire for their fix. Remain calm and insist they seek professional help. Offer your support, not
                your judgment. Try to include them in normal, fun activities that they used to enjoy. This will help
                them in the rehabilitation process. </p>

            <p>If you feel that your gambling has gotten out of control then reach out to a member of your family and
                seek professional help. Distract yourself when the urge arises by engaging in another enjoyable
                activity. Surround yourselves with friends and family, especially if you are feeling the need for
                isolation. People that love you will give you the reality check you need in order to take the next step
                in your recovery process. </p>

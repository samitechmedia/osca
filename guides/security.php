With unscrupulous casino operators, not to mention hackers that are working to intercept your deposits, you can never be too safe. Luckily, though, there are online casino security experts working around the clock to keep these insidious risks at bay. Read on to learn how casino security works so the next horror story doesn't include your name!

					It's so vital to pay attention to your online safety and security at all times and never more so than when entering sensitive information over the internet. All of our chosen slots sites offer:

				<h2 class="title title--h2">How Does Online Casino Security Work in Canada?</h2>
				<p>Security and regulation of online slots casinos can be pretty much broken down into three categories:</p>
				<ul class="dotted type-margin-bottom">
					<li>Generally Accepted Casino Practices</li>
					<li>Safety at the Slots</li>
					<li>Banking security</li>
				</ul>

					<ul class="bullet__list">
						<li class="bullet__item">Ensure that you choose a trustworthy casino that’s approved by an industry body like eCOGRA.</li>

			Each of these requires unique tools and strategies, but they're all generally regulated by the same
            organizations. In the case of Canadian-friendly sites, you'll be depending upon third-party technical auditing firms like <a href="https://gaminglabs.com/about-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="text--link">TST</a> and <a href="https://ecogra.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="text--link">eCOGRA</a>. Their job is to approve the best online casinos by looking at all of these areas and nipping any potential risks in the bud.

		<h2 class="title title--h2">Top Overall Casino Security Features</h2>
		<p>
			The single most important thing to consider is whether or not you trust your online casino. How long have they been in business? What kind of track record do they (and their sister sites) have with other Canadian players? Do they really have your best interests at heart? Remember, even a well maintained and secure online casino may simply rip you off by refusing to payout - which is possible if they have unreasonable terms and conditions.
		</p>
		<p>
			On the other hand, trustworthy, honest online casinos will always make a point of using the latest security features. Things like strict privacy policies to keep your identity under wraps and using secure connections where necessary are just two broad examples. Nobody should have access to your account except for you and they should be very, very careful with any information that they keep on their servers.
		</p>
		<h2 class="title title--h2">Digital Slot Machine Security</h2>
		<p>
			When you're actually playing, it's easy to take the game's fairness for granted, but you cannot really see what's happening under the covers. In short, there's a <a href="/guides/random-number-generators" class="text--link">random number generator</a> (RNG) that powers the game and which should keep things totally fair, but unless your casino is subjected to regular technical auditing, you have no idea if that a slot machine is rigged. Want to read a true story about a rigged RNG online? Check out the BLR Technology scandal to see what's possible.

		<h2 class="title title--h2">Security at the Casino's Cashier</h2>
		<img class="artright lazy" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 173 130'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-src="/images/art/security_cashier.jpg" alt="Casino cashier security" width="173" height="130">
		<p>
			Completing <a href="/deposit/" class="text--link">deposits</a> and withdrawals with your online casino is, without a doubt, the riskiest time for online slots players in Canada. This is when you're sending your account information (banking, credit card, etc.) over the web, and you have to know that your online casino is using encryption to secure your connection.
		</p>
		<p>
			If the site you choose is eCOGRA approved (as are those recommended here), then secure connections with the cashier are a given. Otherwise, look for the padlock next to the URL in your browser to make sure you're protected.
		</p>
		<h2 class="title title--h2">Don't Leave Anything to Chance</h2>
		<p>
			Unless you want to find yourself the next victim of identity theft or fraud, don't leave anything to chance! We've already identified the safest online casinos and posted them here. To take things one step further, we also made sure that these sites work well with Canadians and that they have the best slots action on the web today.

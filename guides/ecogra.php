				<h2 class="title title--h2">A Brief History of eCOGRA</h2>
				<p>
					eCOGRA, or more formally known as eCommerce Online Gaming Regulation and Assurance, was launched from London in 2003. That same year, they established the first online gambling regulation service and instantly changed the industry forever. Today, they're undoubtedly the biggest name in the business, with covered gambling sites registered in the UK, Spain, Denmark, Isle of Man, the Kahnawake reserve in Canada, and Gibraltar, among other countries.
				</p>
				<p>
					This company's challenge was to regulate a gambling industry that's spread all over the world and which relies entirely upon computers to offer a fair game. Determining their standards and figuring out how to implement (and enforce) them certainly was not easy but, today, you can find the results of this process right at the heart of this company, formalized as the eCOGRA Generally Accepted Practices.
				</p>
				<p>
					These rules dictate exactly how an online casino should run to ensure maximum player protection, fair gaming and responsible operator behaviour. To guarantee that these practices are being followed, eCOGRA sends its compliance agents out yearly to review all applicants via detailed onsite visits. They also accept complaints and handle disputes (publically) so that all online casinos are held accountable for their actions and policies.

						eCOGRA plays an incredibly important role in your game, although all of their hard work happens behind the scenes, well out of sight. To see the difference, though, you just have to consider the many sites out there that don't comply with eCOGRA's standards. Things that most players take for granted, like airtight privacy policies and tested RNG's, simply aren't the norm. If you want to make sure that you're protected when you play slots online, you owe it to yourself to limit your options to only those online casinos that carry the eCOGRA seal of approval.

					<p>
						Online casinos that have received eCOGRA's seal of approval are proud to show it, so you rarely have to look far. Just scroll down to the bottom of their page and look at the very bottom edge. Here, you'll find eCOGRA's logo, along with any other organizations that endorse their operation. If you cannot find it here, you may want to go to their About Us page to see if they mention their status with <a href="https://ecogra.org/" class="text--link" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">eCOGRA</a> there. If you cannot find any information in either of these two places, then that specific site is probably not approved. In that case, seriously consider checking out a different site and saving yourself a lot of headaches in the future.

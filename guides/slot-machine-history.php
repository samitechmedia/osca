			From the traditional one armed bandits to internet slots with enough paylines to make your head spin, slots have changed a lot over the years. And thanks to visionary inventors, rapidly advancing technology, and forward-looking casino gamblers, it doesn't look like things are going to slow down any time soon. Read on for a quick look at the history of slot machines - from simple fruit machines to modern million dollar jackpots!
		</p>
		<h2 class="title title--h2">The First Real Slots Machine</h2>
		<p>
			Throughout the mid-1800's, there were a few automatic gambling machines, but based on what we now consider to be a slot machine, the first one was invented by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Fey" class="text--link" target="_blank">Charles Fey</a> in San Francisco in 1887. He wanted to make the machine based on poker but, with 52 cards per reel and so many winning combinations (i.e. payouts), that idea was way ahead of his time.
		</p>
		<p>
			Instead, he dumbed it down and the Liberty Bell machine was born. With three reels and five now-iconic symbols (bells, horseshoes, diamonds, etc.) this machine was the first of its kind and it became a huge success.
		</p>
		<p>
			The overwhelming orders kept Fey's shop running around the clock and he found a new talent - not as an inventor, but as a businessman. He never sold any of his machines but, instead, split the profits 50/50 with whomever was hosting them. Fey became rich and his original <a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/history-of-slot-machines-liberty-bell-1992409" class="text--link" target="_blank">Liberty Bell slots machine</a> is still on display in the Nevada State Museum.

				<h2 class="title title--h2">Slots Machines Enter the Mainstream</h2>
				<p>
					With the obvious business opportunities, inventors began to compete with new slots machine designs, styles, payout structures, etc. These games spread like wildfire and, while they were originally designed for casual gamblers while the real men played table games, by the 1940's, slots had become technically advanced and their revenues finally beat out traditional games. From there on out, the sky was the limit!
				</p>
				<p>
					In 1963, <a href="https://www.arcade-museum.com/manuf_detail.php?manuf_id=116" class="text--link" target="_blank">Bally Manufacturing</a> took a quantum leap with slots gambling when they invented the first electromechanical version: Money Honey. It could finally pay big jackpots automatically, and it was much more technologically advanced than anything that came before it. Most notably, this is also the birth place of the electric lights and noises that accompany all modern slots machines.
				</p>
				<h2 class="title title--h2">Digital Technology Merges with Slots Gambling</h2>
				<p>Then, over a decade later, Fortune Coin Co. released the first <a href="/games/video-slots" class="text--link">video slots</a> game in 1976 and started a trend that would really catch on with the mainstream market in the 80's. These machines finally let players use bills instead of coins, which was a huge logistical step in the right direction, and they also made serious bonus features possible for the first time in slots history. These machines are the forefathers of all of the machines that you see in casinos today, and their software inspired the earliest online casinos.</p>

Also, their integrated gambling software makes it easy for them to seven-figure progressive jackpots right into your living room! Until online gambling took off, there weren't many people that could credit their millionaire status to playing slots!
		</p>

			In the next ten years, get ready to see even more exciting changes in slots technology. With the likely integration between land casinos and online casinos, get ready to see even bigger progressive jackpots. Also, with so much industry transparency, your odds may get better in the future as online casinos compete for Canadian slots players like you.

				What are slot machines?
				<i class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden="true"></i>
				</span>
				<div class="accordion__content">
					<p>
						Slot machines are the inspiration for the online mega game, slots. Main street slot machines are an evolved form of Charles Fey's adaptation of the trade simulation machines of the era. Over the last century and more, these machines have captured the nation's imagination and found a place in the hearts of many.

				Are they legal in Canada?
				<i class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden="true"></i>
				</span>
				<div class="accordion__content">
					<p>
						Depending on where you wish to play, yes. Differing from other countries in gambling laws, Canada's gambling rules are applied under provincial jurisdiction. With the exception of New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Newfoundland and Labrador, casino "style" gaming is legal which, fortunately for you guys, includes slot machines. That said, internet gambling is not a form of legalized gambling.

				Can I still play the older slot variations?
				<i class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden="true"></i>
				</span>
				<div class="accordion__content">
					<p>
						If you can find them, you can play them. Retro themed bars and casinos often offer the older versions for prosperity and old school charm. I'm not going to lie to you though, they are not easy to find.

				<span class="accordion-item__title type-display-flex type-flex-justify-between">
				Are they really random?
				<i class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden="true"></i>
				</span>
				<div class="accordion__content">
					<p>
						Don't worry, all slots are random. Any land based casino or online casino offering a non-random slot machine or game is not, quite frankly, worth its salt. The computer that powers the game generates its line orders at random.

			<div class="accordion__item">
				<span class="accordion-item__title type-display-flex type-flex-justify-between">
				Can they be beaten?
				<i class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden="true"></i>
				</span>
				<div class="accordion__content">
					<p>
						There are no quantifiable odds with a slot game. The reels don’t overload and, while there is only so much real money a slot machine can take, the RNG inside ensures that there is no time limit on payouts. And, while many good people will attempt to convince you that they know a secret, you can't really beat them as such. You can however still win very, very big.

				<span class="accordion-item__title type-display-flex type-flex-justify-between">
				Are they more likely to payout at certain times?
				<i class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden="true"></i>
				</span>
				<div class="accordion__content">
					<p>
						Nope, sorry again. Each spin is random and independent from ALL previous spins. This means that the next jackpot win has no relation whatsoever to the last jackpot win. The computer chip running the Random Number Generator (RNG) inside is constantly cycling through the internal numbers even while the machine is idle, meaning the "due" jackpot isn't actually due after all.

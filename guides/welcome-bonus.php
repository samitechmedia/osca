                    <h2 class="title title--h2">Why Bonuses are Offered?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Finding the best online slots bonus is a priority for many gamblers. Often, when looking for the
                        right casino operator, the bonus is a deal breaker. These companies know this and work fervently
                        to offer a bonus you simply cannot surpass. If you’re wondering why, it’s a simple business
                        tactic. Like land based casinos offer free buffets or rooms to attract players, online casinos
                        offer bonuses. In a digital world where there are literally thousands of competitors and a few
                        hundred really good ones, the bonus is used to gain loyal customers. The overhead costs are far
                        lower than those of a land based casino which is why real money can be laid on the table.

                This is the core reason why you need to find the best online slots casino bonus. Like wine and caviar,

                You’ll discover a wide range of different casino bonuses. Each one will come with varying options and
                requirements. Although we’ve covered the main details you should know, it’s always a good idea to read
                through
                the terms and conditions on the site itself.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>The Sign Up Bonus</strong> – Also known as the ‘Welcome Bonus’, this is by far the best bonus
                for online slots. If played correctly, you can receive thousands of extra dollars from this one time
                only bonus. That’s right, this offer is only available immediately after you register for an account and
                make a deposit. If you choose not to collect it at that time, you won’t have a second chance for that
                very bonus. Some sites will add the bonus money in full to your account, but most will offer it in
                installments. For every deposit you make, a portion of the bonus will be given to you. Before you choose
                one of our recommended slots operators, there are some attached strings to know about. You will need to
                make the playthrough requirements before you can withdraw your winnings. This is very easy and we’ll
                discuss more in just a moment.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>The No-Deposit Bonus</strong> – You’ll find a number of operators which give you the chance to
                test the waters before you add real money to your account. Known as a no-deposit bonus, you simply need
                to sign up for an account and play your favourite slot games. You can start adding cash to your bankroll
                from lucky spins, but you may not be able to withdraw it. Some casinos only allow this money to be
                played on the site. Others will let you withdraw it after you’ve met the deposit requirements. Read the
                fine print before you agree to the terms.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Slots Deposit Bonuses</strong> – Once you find the perfect site, you’ll be rewarded with regular
                bonuses each time you make a deposit. These are typically a percentage of your deposit and are very
                valuable. As a golden rule, always sign up to the casino’s newsletter. These often contain weekly
                deposit incentives and other opt-in only promotions.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Free Play Bonuses</strong> – You won’t find these bonuses on every site, but they are around.
                They will give you a small amount of money to play slots online without making a deposit. The difference
                between free play and no deposit bonuses is that usually the former is offered only for select games. In
                addition, you may have a time limit or specified amount of playing. Once these limits run out, you will
                be asked to add real cash to your bankroll. Read over the terms and conditions to verify whether or not
                winnings from the free play are able to be
                withdrawn.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Refer a Friend Bonus</strong> – As it sounds if you refer a friend to your favourite slots
                online casino,
                and they sign up, you will be given a special bonus. These can be very lucrative and add up quickly.
                Plus, you’ll be able to play the best real money games with your buddies.

            <p class="type-margin-bottom">
                All too often, a slots casino-goer becomes distracted by the amount of the bonus and chooses the bigger
                one over a secondary option which is actually better. In general, larger bonuses have the most stringent
                requirements. Some are so high that if you’re not a frequent player or planning on spending a lot of
                money, you will struggle to meet the playthrough requirements. The smaller bonuses can actually pan out
                in the long run. The requirements are easy to clear meaning you actually get your value for money.

            <h2 class="title title--h2">FAQ for Online Slots Bonuses</h2>
            <p>
                The following are the most frequently asked questions about online slots bonuses.
            </p>
            <div class="faq__accordion">

                        <p>
                            Every bonus will come with playthrough requirements which are laid out in the terms and
                            conditions. These greatly vary from one operator to another and range from 10x to 60x or
                            more of the bonus plus your deposit. For example, if you deposit $100 and you need to meet a
                            20x playthrough on a 100% match deposit, you will need wager $2000 total. At first it may
                            sound like a lot, but the chances of you breaking even or winning your money back with the
                            bonus are rather good. If this wasn’t attainable, no player would ever take advantage of the
                            bonus and would eventually cease to exist.

                            Some casinos will implement stake limits on a bonus. This is often for games geared towards
                            high rollers or for high limit bets. When playing online slots, you shouldn’t encounter any
                            issues preventing you from making average wagers with a bonus.

                            allow this, they will state this rule in their terms. Generally, as long as you’re meeting

			Caesars belongs on any list of the top casinos and is a favourite of Canadian and American players alike.

A lot of the action goes down at the 2,300+ slot machines which start out at just C$0.25. Unique to the slot machines is the Total Touch technology which allows you to order your favourite cocktail with just the touch of a button.  It doesn’t affect the game, but it’s a cool feature. You can also try your luck at any one of the 75 table games including private VIP tables. The recent expansion has turned the 24-7 casino into a fully inclusive holiday resort where you’ll find a 5,000 seat entertainment venue and the first Canadian Sports Book.

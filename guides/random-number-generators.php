                        The whirling sounds, the flashing lights, the anticipation of a winning combination, playing
                        games at online casinos is an exciting experience enjoyed by thousands of Canadians, we love the
                        thrill of pressing the &quot;spin&quot; button, but what&apos;s really going on behind those
                        reels while they&apos;re spinning, eh? <a href="/guides/slot-machines-work" class="text--link">What
                            makes slot machines work?</a> And how do those combinations appear? It&apos;s all about the
                        software, powering random number generators, or RNGs. Understanding how these RNGs work is not
                        only your key to understanding the slot reel combinations, it&apos;s your key to developing a

                    <p>
                        Traditional slot machines were originally placed in land-based casinos as an entry point game
                        for casual gamblers, because they didn&apos;t require much skill or strategy. Simply pulling a
                        handle to play--what could be easier than that? It was a winning strategy, and slot machines are
                        still wildly popular in both offline and <a href="/online-casinos">online casinos</a>. </p>
                    <p>
                        These original slot machines featured three reels inside, each sporting various images and
                        numbers. After a player pulled the machine&apos;s handle, the mechanism inside, a system of
                        gears and levers along shafts, kept reels spinning while the handle moved back in place. When
                        the handle arrived in its original spot, a brake system stopped the notched disks attached to
                        those reels, random generating various reel combinations. Each pull of the handle kept the
                        combinations random and the odds fair. </p>

                When <a href="/guides/slot-machine-history" class="text--link">digital slots machines</a> came to be,
                they were designed to look like their original predecessors, but inside was a different process at work
                for random combinations. The mechanisms gave way to micro-chips, and now both land-based and online
                casinos sport computerized, rather than mechanized, slot machines. And instead of handle timing and
                brake systems to create reel combinations, slot machine software generates random numbers to give you a
                fair shot at a winning combination. </p>

            <h2 class="title title--h2">RNG&apos;s Help With Fair Play At Casinos</h2>
            <p>
                With mechanized slot machines, timing was what guaranteed a random reel combination and therefore a fair
                shot to hit the jackpot. But with computerized and online slot machines, the software programs a way for
                the same random combination possibilities to ensure a fair game. Before you even start your game, the
                software&apos;s RNG produces numbers at several hundred combinations per second to keep these sequences
                arbitrary. And when you press the &quot;spin&quot; button to start your game, the next number
                combination tells the program when the virtual reels should stop spinning. This gives you the same fair
                shot at winning combinations online that you&apos;ve always been able to expect in land casinos. </p>

                                    A Random Number Generator is just a piece of software that runs within your online
                                    casino. Its goal is to make sure that, when you send the slots reels spinning, they
                                    stop in a random position. Assuming they&apos;re not rigged, RNG&apos;s are the key
                                    to getting a fair casino game online - whether it&apos;s slots, blackjack, or any
                                    other game of chance. Essentially, RNG technology is the technological key that
                                    makes online gambling possible. </p>

                                    Number Generators</a> take a starting number (called the &quot;seed number&quot;),
                                and then use a complicated algorithm to calculate a new, random number based on it.
                                Then, that new number becomes the seed, and the same algorithm is used to generate a new
                                number. This process continues over and over and, while each new number is based on the
                                previous one, there&apos;s no way to predict what the next number will be unless you
                                actually know what the original seed number was. </p>
                            <p>
                                Now, before we continue, we need to mention that these numbers are huge. The most common
                                Random Number Generators in the industry work with random numbers that have 219,937
                                digits! The reels on a slots machine have something like twelve options each, so 1/12 of
                                the countless possible random numbers correspond to each of the possible casino
                                outcomes. </p>

                                So now it&apos;s time to answer the million dollar question! As you may have guessed, a
                                Random Number Generator is not literally random - each number is ultimately based on the
                                seed number and, if you knew that, you could beat the system. </p>
                            <p>
                                However, these numbers are kept closely under wraps and out of reach. There&apos;s also
                                the risk that an online casino could rig their RNG or use additional software to skew
                                the numbers in their favour. This is a very real risk (it has happened before) and there
                                is only really one way around it: third party auditing. </p>
                            <p>
                                So are Random Number Generators fair? Well, they are as fair as the companies that are
                                operating them. The one and only option that you have to guarantee that you&apos;re
                                getting a fair slots game is to play with the top sites that have passed third-party
                                testing and auditing (look for the

                                seal of approval). Other than the realities of foul play, for all practical purposes,
                                you can count on the fairness of your site&apos;s RNG. </p>

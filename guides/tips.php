        <h1 class="title title--h2">Top 10 Tips To Win More At Slots</h1>
        <p>
            All online slot games use something called a <a href="/guides/random-number-generators" class="text--link">Random Number Generator (RNG)</a> that determines the results of each spin. What this means for you, the player, is that slot machine games are purely games of luck. There is no guarantee that your spin will be a winner. Even a game with a 98% payout percentage is based on an average payout and doesn't mean that any specific spin of yours be a winner.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, there are still a number of important tips for online slots that will help you improve your playing experience and get more enjoyment out of your game play. In fact, 10 tips weren't enough so we threw in one extra! And yes, there are even tips to help you increase your chances of winning big!
        </p>
        <h2 class="title title--h2"><span class="title__number">1</span>  Play For Free To Test The Waters</h2>
        <p>
            Many online slot games have <a href="/free" class="text--link">free versions</a> or online demos that you can try out before you commit money to your play. Internet casinos have their terms of service that describe the types of welcome bonuses they offer and may even post the payout percentages of their games. Reputable casinos will also detail how they handle security and whom they work with to independently verify that their RNG is reliable. Look around and make an informed decision before you deposit funds.
        </p>
        <h2 class="title title--h2"><span class="title__number">2</span>  Don't Waste Time With Boring Slots Games</h2>
        <p>
            The best slot machine game for you depends upon the type of experience you are looking for. Since Internet slots come in a variety of styles and vary in terms of the type of payout they offer, think about your goals before you play. Some slot games are cinematic masterpieces, offering blockbuster quality graphics (some in 3D) and sound. Other games may be less like a movie experience but may have a payout table that matches your gambling style.
        </p>
        <h2 class="title title--h2"><span class="title__number">3</span>  Study The Paylines To Know Your Payouts</h2>
        <p>
            Remember that online slots games differ in the number of paylines they offer. Some have only a small number while others can have hundreds. Games where you can play more paylines offer you more chances to win per spin. Some <a href="/guides/slot-machine-history" class="text--link">Internet slot machines</a> have special prizes when you play a certain payline or offer jackpots if you play the maximum number of paylines. In general, it is a good idea to look for a large number of paylines and play the maximum number of paylines possible to maximize your chances of winning.
        </p>
        <p>
            Remember that the payout is based upon having winning combinations of symbols (from left to right) on only the paylines you have selected (active paylines). Your enjoyment of the game may be reduced if you spin and see an unattainable payout because it is on a payline that you didn't activate.
        </p>
        <h2 class="title title--h2"><span class="title__number">4</span>  Understand Progressive Jackpots And How To Play For Them</h2>
        <p>
            Some online slot games offer jackpot prize pools. A non-progressive or stand-alone jackpot is one where the jackpot is based upon play at that specific online slot machine. The prize is fixed and does not vary. A <a href="/progressive-jackpots" class="text--link">progressive jackpot</a> slot game is linked to a network of players spinning slots at multiple Internet casinos.
        </p>
        <p>
            In both cases, each time you bet and spin, a portion of that bet is added to the jackpot. If you win the jackpot pool, the amount of money won can be big and even a life-changing sum of money. Here, the amount you can win is based upon the total number of bets that have been added to the prize pool and can vary. The jackpot is usually triggered by hitting a specified combination of the highest paying symbols.
        </p>
        <h2 class="title title--h2"><span class="title__number">5</span>  Large jackpot prizes are designed to be hard to win.</h2>
        <p>
            There are generally specific conditions that must be met in order for you to win the jackpot. Usually you must play the maximum number of paylines and be betting the maximum value and amount of coins possible in order to be eligible for the jackpot prize.
        </p>
        <p>
            Don't forget that there is a RNG working behind the scenes. Just because a jackpot hasn't been won in a long time doesn't mean that it is "due" to hit. Generally, lower jackpot slot games will hit the jackpot more often than higher jackpot games.
        </p>
        <h2 class="title title--h2"><span class="title__number">6</span>  Pay Attention To How Many Symbols A Game Has</h2>
        <p>
            Check out how many different symbols an online slot game has. The more symbols it has, the more possible combinations each spin will have. The upside is that there will likely be more special symbols that equal larger payouts. However, the downside is that the more symbols available in a slot machine, the less likely you'll hit multiples of any given symbol.
        </p>
        <h2 class="title title--h2"><span class="title__number">7</span> Learn The Rules Specific To A Game</h2>
        <p>
            It is important to check out the rules of the online slot game you're playing and make sure you understand if there are any special rules involved. For example, certain prizes may be possible only when you bet the maximum number of coins and play the maximum number of paylines. Another example involves the behaviour of wildcard symbols that differ from one game to the next. Know what combinations trigger bonus games or free spins.
        </p>
        <h2 class="title title--h2"><span class="title__number">8</span>  Choose A Comfortable Coin Size</h2>
        <p>
            Online slot games usually offer a range of coin denominations that can be used per line/per spin. If a game takes bets between 1 and 25 coins, and has 100 paylines, your spin can cost anywhere from 1 coin (playing only one payline for the minimum bet) up to 2,500 coins (maximum bet over the maximum number of paylines).
        </p>

            </svg>
            <div>Depending upon your bankroll for playing slots online, you could play all day or lose your entire roll within one spin! So think about how much money you have set aside for playing and calculate how often you want to spin for the maximum bet and largest number of paylines. Then pick a slot game that will let you get the maximum amount of play time for your budget.</div>
        </div>
        <h2 class="title title--h2"><span class="title__number">9</span>  Don't Gamble What You Cannot Afford To Lose</h2>
        <p>
            Online slot games are pure chance and pure gambling. There is never a guarantee that you will win at the game. You should always have a clear idea of the amount of money you are willing to lose and only play with that amount. Set a playing budget and stick to it always.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is easy to be tempted to redeposit and keep playing after you have lost your entire bankroll in order to "win it back." But this is a strategy that is highly discouraged. Gambling (online or otherwise) is entertainment until you start playing with money that you can't afford to lose. Know your limits and stop when you have hit them.
        </p>
        <h2 class="title title--h2"><span class="title__number">10</span> Grab Those Online Casino Bonuses</h2>
        <p>
            Many online casinos will offer <a href="/guides/welcome-bonus" class="text--link">welcome bonuses</a> to new players and to players making subsequent deposits of funds. These bonuses can double your initial bankroll. Know the rules and make sure to maximizes the playing power of your deposit.
        </p>
        <p>
            Make sure you understand what you have to do in order to release the extra money and be able to cash it out. Casinos may offer reward programs for certain volumes of play. Understand what the casino is offering to win your loyalty and continued play and take advantage of these offers as best as you can.
        </p>
        <h2 class="title title--h2"><span class="title__number">11</span>  Understand That Slots Is A Game Of Luck</h2>
        <p>
            You may hear many strategy tips for winning at slot games. While there are definitely strategies for maximising your potential wins, there is no guaranteed way to know that any given spin will be a winner.
        </p>
        <p>
            A game is never "hot" or "cold." The RNG determines that each spin has exactly the same chance of hitting a winning combination as any other spin. This also means that a long stretch of no hits is completely unrelated to whether your next spin will be a winner or not.

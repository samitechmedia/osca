	# The ServerName directive sets the request scheme, hostname and port that
	# the server uses to identify itself. This is used when creating
	# redirection URLs. In the context of virtual hosts, the ServerName
	# specifies what hostname must appear in the request's Host: header to
	# match this virtual host. For the default virtual host (this file) this
	# value is not decisive as it is used as a last resort host regardless.
	# However, you must set it for any further virtual host explicitly.

	# For most configuration files from conf-available/, which are
	# enabled or disabled at a global level, it is possible to
	# include a line for only one particular virtual host. For example the
	# following line enables the CGI configuration for this host only
	# after it has been globally disabled with "a2disconf".
	#Include conf-available/serve-cgi-bin.conf

	#  SSL Engine Switch:
	#   Enable/Disable SSL for this virtual host.

	#   A self-signed (snakeoil) certificate can be created by installing
	#   the ssl-cert package. See
	#   /usr/share/doc/apache2/README.Debian.gz for more info.
	#   If both key and certificate are stored in the same file, only the
	#   SSLCertificateFile directive is needed.
